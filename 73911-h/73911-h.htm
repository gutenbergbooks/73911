<br>
 <span class="large">LORD STANLEY, M.P.</span></p>

<p>
<span class="allsmcap">MY DEAR LORD,</span> 
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> desire to inscribe this page with your
name, is associated with the recollection of
the period when you filled one of the highest
administrative offices in Ireland; and when
your firm and vigorous discharge of it,
effectually stifled the designs of those, whose
measures, if tolerated, would have drawn
down upon that country, consequences similar
to those which similar proceedings
have, unhappily, entailed upon Belgium. The
value and effect of that nervous policy, by
which you “boldly muzzled treason” then,
is attested by the contrast, which the social
condition of Ireland exhibits now, under
the nominal government of those who have
submitted to abandon it; and whose sacrifices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
to purchase the loyalty, and secure the
permanent attachment of the Irish Repealers,
have been rewarded by an intimation
of a prospective fraternization with the
“hereditary enemies of England,” so soon
as their “compact alliance,” with the English
administration shall have expired.</p>

<p>“History is philosophy teaching by example;”
and it is not to be supposed that
there are not, even amongst the zealots for
the Repeal of the Union in Ireland, some
few who will be attentive to its lessons:
it is chiefly in this anxious hope, that I
have transcribed the present volumes. The
more so too, because Belgium is the one
bright example, which those who have addressed
themselves to unsettle the allegiance
of the Irish people, have always ostentatiously
paraded for their imitation and
encouragement. From this selection they
cannot now retreat; and I confidently believe,
that the exposition contained in the
following pages of the condition of that
country, after ten years of separation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
independence, will exhibit Belgium to Ireland,
if as an example at all, only as—</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
Exemplar vitiis imitabile.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Neither the social nor the material prosperity
of Belgium, affords anything encouraging
to the hopes of those who can profit
by the experience of others; and as, in
Ireland, the materials in which the vital
experiment must be made are similar, the
results to be anticipated must be the same.
With Popery, merely as a complexion of
Christianity—as a distinctly marked form
of religion—a legislator has no further concern,
than as regards the question of enlightened
toleration. But <i>political Popery</i>,
that character in which the followers of the
Church of Rome, are exhibiting themselves
in Belgium and in Ireland—“resting their
lever on one world,” as Dryden says, “to
move another at their will”—enters essentially,
and of necessity, into the investigation
and study of the statesman. And, in no
instance, in modern times, has it so unreservedly
exhibited itself, as in the conception,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
the achievement, and the results, of the
Belgian revolution. It remains to be seen,
whether the Liberal party in Ireland, whose
co-operation encourages and sustains the
advocates of the Repeal of the Union, will
relish the prospect of such an absolute religious
ascendancy of the majority in that
country, as that which has succeeded to the
most absolute freedom of worship, and the
most unlimited liberty of conscience in the
Low Countries.</p>

<p>On the score of substantial and material
prosperity, a similar question must arise.
The application of machinery to every
branch of production, has effected a revolution
in the economy of European manufactures,
which is only paralleled by the
effects, upon learning, of the discovery of
printing. The poorest, and, occasionally,
the smallest communities, have been, at
various times, the most successful producers
of certain commodities, which were
the offspring of hand labour, and the
fruits of individual dexterity; and the price
of which, therefore, was not sensibly affected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
by the greater or less amount of their
consumption. But when human ingenuity
became infused into iron—when the industry
and adroitness of a million of hands had
been concentrated in the single arm of the
Briareus of steam—the movements of the
mighty prodigy became necessarily expanded
in proportion to its power, and required
a correspondingly enlarged field for their
display. To produce successfully by machinery,
it is indispensible to produce extensively;
but Belgium, apparently unconscious
of this important truth, proceeded to
contract, instead of enlarging, her limits;
and her powers of production, thus cribbed
and restrained, without the opportunity of
exercise, have pined and wasted away and
are now on the brink of decay.</p>

<p>The two banks, east and west of the
Rhine, present at this moment a singular
and striking illustration of the opposite
effects of the cultivation or neglect of this
principle in modern manufacture. <i>To the
right</i>, we have the numerous little industrious
states and principalities of Western Germany,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
each ambitious of acquiring manufacturing
power, and each possessing it to a certain
extent; but each unable, till lately, to succeed
or prosper, owing to the narrowness
of its individual bounds; till, at last,
awakened to a consciousness of their real
and actual wants, they, by one simultaneous
movement, levelled every intervening barrier,
and threw their united territories into
the one grand area of the Prussian Commercial
League; the success of which has
hitherto realized their utmost expectations.</p>

<p><i>On the left</i> of the Rhine we had, ten
years ago, Belgium and Holland enjoying
that <i>union</i> which Germany has but lately
attained, and reaping all the advantages
which it was possible to derive from it—till,
in the “madness of the hour,” the latter
undid the very bonds of her prosperity,
reversed the process by which Germany is
rising to prosperity, and, resorting to repeal
and separation, she has lost, as a matter
of course, every advantage which she had
drawn from union and co-operation. A
similar proceeding cannot fail to inflict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
similar calamities upon Ireland; and the same
destruction of her manufactures which has
followed the exclusion of Belgium from the
markets and the colonies of Holland, would
inevitably overtake the manufacturers of
Ireland, if placed upon the footing of a
stranger and a rival in the ports and
colonies of Great Britain.</p>

<p>It is with an ardent hope that the question
of the Repeal of the Union in Ireland
may be tested by arguments such as these,
by those who will pause to weigh it at all,
that I have ventured to bring before its
advocates the real condition of that country
which their own leader has selected for
their example and their model. And conscious
of the deep interest which your
Lordship has ever taken in the condition
of Ireland, and your intimate acquaintance
with her wants and her resources, I am
anxious to recommend my exertions to
notice by the prestige of your name.</p>

<p>At the same time, as I have never submitted
to you in conversation or otherwise
the contents of these volumes, it is possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
that you may dissent from opinions which
I have ventured to express. But my object
has been merely to collect facts as to the
influence of the recent revolution, and I
neither discuss the policy of the settlement
of Holland as concluded at the Congress of
Vienna, nor question the prudence of those
governments in Europe, which, after the
events of 1830, found it necessary to put
an end to hostilities by concurring in the
independence of Belgium.</p>

<p class="center">
I remain,
<br>
My dear Lord,
<br>
Most truly yours,
<br>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> details regarding the commerce and
manufactures of Belgium, which will be
found in the following pages, are the result
of personal enquiry, corrected by the annual
statistical returns, published by the
Belgian Government, and confirmed by the
labours of M. Briavionne in a recent work,
to which I have frequently referred—“<i>De
L’Industrie en Belgique</i>.” It may, also, give
them some additional weight, to add, that
the opinions expressed, arose out of visits
made to the principal manufacturing districts,
accompanied by two gentlemen of
extensive practical acquaintance with the
manufacturers of Great Britain; Mr. Thomson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
of Primrose, near Clitheroe, and Mr.
J. Mulholland, of Belfast, a member of a
family, the extent of whose machinery and
productions in the staple commodity of
Ireland—the linen trade—is, I believe, the
greatest in the kingdom. And though these
volumes, or their contents, have not actually
been submitted to their inspection, I believe
that I have their perfect concurrence in the
sentiments which they embody, upon the
subject of the trade and manufactures of
Belgium.</p>

<p class="right">
September, 1840.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> sunset when about ten to fifteen miles
from land, we had the first sight of the
coast of the “Low Countries,” not as on
other shores discernible by hills or cliffs,
but by the steeples of Nieuport, Ostend,
and Blankenburg rising out of the water;
presently a row of wind-mills, and the tops
of a few trees and houses, and finally a long
line of level sand stretching away towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
Walcheren and the delta of the Scheldt.
Within fourteen hours from heaving up our
anchor at the Tower, we cast it in the
harbour of Ostend, a narrow estuary
formed where the waters of a little river
have forced their way through the sand-banks
to the sea. An excellent quay has
been constructed by flanking the sides of
this passage with extensive piers of timber,
whilst the stream being confined by dams
and sluices above, is allowed to rush down
at low water, carrying before it to the sea,
any silt which may have been deposited by
the previous tide.</p>

<p>At the inner extremity of the harbour,
spacious basins have been constructed for
the accommodation of the craft which ply
upon the Canal de Bruges, which connects
that town with Ghent and Ostend, but its
traffic is now much diminished by the
opening of the railroad, as well as from
other causes.</p>

<p>Neither the police nor the custom-house
officials, gave any inconvenience with our
passports or our baggage, beyond a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
minutes of unavoidable delay, and within
half an hour from the packet touching the
pier, we found ourselves arranged for the
night at the Hotel de la Cour Impériale
in the Rue de la Chapelle.</p>

<p>I may here mention as a piece of recommendatory
information to future travellers,
that the journey, of which these volumes
are a memento, was performed in an open
English carriage, the back seat of
which was sufficiently roomy to accommodate
three persons, leaving the front for
our books, maps and travelling comforts,
and the box for our courier and a postillion;
and that except upon mountain roads, we
made the entire tour of Belgium, Rhenish
Prussia, and Germany, from Bavaria to
Hanover, with a pair of horses. For such
a journey, no construction of carriage that
I have seen is equal to the one which we
used, a britscka, with moveable head, and
windows which rendered it perfectly close
at night or during rain.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I have not made
a minute calculation as to expenses, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
even on the score of economy, I am inclined
to think this mode of travelling, for three
persons and a servant, will involve <i>less
actual outlay</i> than the fares of diligences,
and Eil Wagens or Schnell posts. In Belgium,
our posting, with two horses, including
postillions, fees and tolls, did not
exceed, throughout, elevenpence a mile;
in Prussia, ninepence; and in Bavaria, even
less. Besides the perfect control of one’s
own time and movements, is a positive
source of economy, as it avoids expense at
hotels, while waiting for the departure of
stages and public conveyances, after the
traveller is satisfied with his stay in the
place where he may find himself, and is
anxious to get forward to another. Between
the advantages gained in this particular, and
the means of travelling comfortably at
night almost without loss of sleep, through
some of the sandy and uninteresting plains
of northern Germany, I am fully of opinion
that our English carriage, independently of
its comparative luxury, not only diminished
the expense of our journey, but actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
added some weeks to its length, within the
period which we had assigned for our return.
In Belgium, however, and Saxony where
railroads are extensively opened, a carriage
affords no increase of convenience, on the
contrary, in <i>short stages</i>, which should be
avoided, it will be found to augment the
expense without expediting the journey.</p>

<p>Ostend presents but a bad subject for the
compilers of guide books, as it does not
possess a single “lion,” nor a solitary object,
either of ancient or modern interest, for
the tourist. Its aspect too is unsatisfactory,
it is neither Dutch, French, nor Flemish,
but a mixture of all three, and its houses
with Dutch roofs, Flemish fronts, and
French interiors, are painted all kinds of
gaudy colours, red, green and blue, and
covered with polyglot sign boards, announcing
the nature of the owner’s calling
within, in almost all the languages of Northern
Europe.</p>

<p>Being built in a dead flat, the town has
of course no sewers—it was Saturday evening
when we arrived, and in honour of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
approaching Sabbath, I presume, every house
within the walls seemed busied in pumping
out its cesspool and washing the contents
along the channels of the streets, creating
an atmosphere above that “all the
perfumes of Arabia would not sweeten.”
This, however, is an incident by no means
peculiar to Ostend, the great majority of
the cities in the “Low Countries” being
similarly circumstanced.</p>

<p>Although a place of importance five
hundred years ago, every trace of antiquity
in Ostend has been destroyed by the many
“battles, sieges, fortunes,” it has passed. It
was enclosed in the fifteenth century, fortified
by the Prince of Orange in the sixteenth,
and almost razed to the ground in its defence
against the Spaniards in the seventeenth,
when Sir Francis Vere, (one the military
cavaliers, whom, with Sir Philip Sydney and
others, Elizabeth in her capricious sympathy,
had from time to time sent to the aid of the
protestant cause in the Netherlands), held
its command at the close of its remarkable
siege by the forces of the Archdukes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Albert and Isabella.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This memorable
siege, which the system of antiquated
tactics then in vogue, protracted for
upwards of three years, “became a school
for the young nobility of all Europe,
who repaired, to either one or the other
party, to learn the principles and the practice
of attack and defence.” The brothers
Ambrose and Frederick Spinola here earned
their high reputation as military strategists,
and the former eventually forced Ostend
to surrender, after every building had
been levelled by artillery, and innumerable
thousands had found a grave around its
walls. In the subsequent troubles of the
eighteenth century, it was again repeatedly
besieged and taken, sharing in all these
disastrous wars which have earned for
Belgium, the appropriate soubriquet of the
“Cock-pit of Europe.” Its fortifications
are still maintained in tolerable repair, one
large battery called Fort Wellington, is of
modern construction, and a long rampart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
which was originally designed to protect
the town from the inundation of the sea, has
been converted into a glacis, and strengthened
with stone, brought, at a considerable
cost, from Tournay, as the alluvial sands of
Flanders cannot supply even paving stones
for her own cities. The summit of this
defence is an agreeable promenade along
the sea, which rolls up to its base, and as
far as the eye can reach, stretch long hills
of sand, which the wind sets in motion,
and has driven into heaps against the walls
and fortifications. The level and beautiful
strand, however, renders Ostend an agreeable
bathing-place, and it is fashionably frequented
for that purpose during the months
of summer, when the town presents the
usual <i>agréments</i> of a watering place, baths,
ball rooms, cafés, and a theatre.</p>

<p>As the second sea-port in the kingdom,
it enjoys a considerable share of the
shipping trade of Belgium, but it has no
manufactures, and the chief emoluments
of the lower classes, arise from the fishery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
of herrings and oysters, the bed of the
latter, “le parc aux huitres,” being the
leading lion recommended by the valet-de-place,
to the notice of the stranger at
Ostend; and the green oysters of Ostend
(<i>huitres vertes d’Ostende</i>), one of the luxuries
of the Parisian gourmands. Oysters
are, indeed, the first dish introduced at
every Belgian dinner-table, and the facility
of the railroad has considerably augmented
the demand at Ostend.</p>

<p>The herring fishery has, of late years,
almost disappeared from the coast of Flanders.
It was once one of the most lucrative
branches of trade in the Low Countries;
and Charles V, when he visited the
grave of Beukelson, who discovered the
method of pickling herrings, at Biervliet,
near Sluys, caused a monument to be
erected over his remains. With the
Reformation, however, and the lax observance
of Lent upon the continent, the demand
for salted fish declined, and Holland
herself now retains but a remnant of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
ancient trade; which, however, she cultivates
with a rigid observance of all its ancient
formalities—the little fleet of fishing
boats assemble annually at Vlaardingen, at
the entrance of the Maas—the officers assemble
at the Stad-huis, and take the ancient
oath to respect the laws of the fishery;
they then hoist their respective flags, and
repair to the church to offer up prayers for
their success. The day of their departure
is a holiday on the river. The first cargo
which reaches Holland, is bought at an extravagant
price, and the first barrel which is
landed on the shore, is forwarded as a present
to the King.</p>

<p>Ostend, Blankenburg, Nieuport, Antwerp,
and even Bruges, had once a valuable
share in this important fishery, but it
has of late years been utterly lost; not
more than three sloops, we were told, having
put to sea in any year since 1837, and
even then with indifferent success. The
cod-fishery, however, has been more prosperous,
employing between five and six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
hundred seamen at Ostend alone; but even
this is bolstered and sustained by the unsound
expedient of government bounties.</p>

<h3>BRUGES.</h3>

<p>We left Ostend for Bruges by the railroad,
sending forward our carriage to
Ghent. The fare for the entire distance
is little more than for one half, the trouble
of mounting and dismounting, being the
same for the longer as for the shorter
stage. The arrangements of the railroad
differ in no essential particular from those
of England, except that every passenger’s
luggage is more scrupulously examined
and charged for extra weight, after which,
it is taken from the custody of the owner,
who receives a ticket, on the production
of which, it is delivered up to him,
on reaching the town for which his place
has been secured. This system, however,
is found to be productive of frequent
mistakes and confusion, from trunks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
portmanteaus being sent beyond their destination,
or left behind altogether. The conductors
and officials are all arrayed in uniform,
and the starting of the train from
each station is announced by a few notes
of a trumpet. The engines are chiefly of
English manufacture, with the exception of
a few made at Liege.</p>

<p>Belgium is of all countries in Europe the
best calculated for railroads; its vast alluvial
plains, hardly presenting a perceptible
inequality. From Ostend to Ghent, I
scarcely noticed a single cutting or an embankment,
the rails being laid upon the
natural surface of the ground, and the direction
as straight as the flight of an arrow,
without the necessity of a curve or inclination,
except to approach some village station
on the road.</p>

<p>The old mode of conveyance by the
Trekschuit, on the Canal de Bruges, though
not discontinued, is comparatively deserted
for the railroad. It is, however, by no
means disagreeable, the boats being drawn
along at the rate of nearly six miles an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
hour, the accommodation excellent and
unique, and the only drawback, the effluvia
which in summer arises from the almost
stagnant waters of the canal, occasionally
heightened by the poisoned streams in
which flax had been steeped by the farmers,
which is instantly fatal to the fish.</p>

<p>The air and general appearance of Bruges,
on entering it by the railroad, which passes
direct into the centre of the town, cannot
fail to arrest the interest and attention of a
stranger. It is unlike any place that one has
been accustomed to before, and is certainly
the most perfect specimen of a town of the
middle ages on this side the Rhine. Its
houses have not been rebuilt in modern
times, and with their ample fronts, vast
arched entrances and sculptured ornaments,
and fantastic gables, are all in keeping with
our stately impressions of its feudal counts
and affluent but turbulent burghers. “Le
voyageur,” says its historian, M. Ferrier,
“au milieu de ces vieux hôtels, de ces
pierres féodales encore debout, espère toujours
qu’une noble dame au chaperon de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
velours et au vertugadin élargi, va sortir
des portes basses en ogives le faucon au
poign, la queue retroussée par un page.”</p>

<p>Instead of the narrow, dingy passages
which occur in cities of similar antiquity
and renown, there is an air peculiarly gay
and imposing in the broad and cheerful
streets of Bruges; its streets enlivened by
long lines of lindens and oriental plane
trees, and traversed by canals, not sluggish
and stagnant, but flowing with an active
current through the city. Upon these, the
wealthier mansions open to the rear, a
little ornamented “pleasance” separating
them from the river, laid out in angular
walks, and ornamented with evergreens,
clipped <i>en quenouille</i>, and here and there a
statue or an antique vase. The squares
maintain the same character of dignity and
gravity, overshadowed with “old ancestral
trees,” and flanked by their municipal
halls and towers—the monuments of a time
when Bruges was the Tyre of Western Europe,
and her Counts and citizens combined
the enterprize and wealth of the merchant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
with the fiery bearing of the soldier. 
These edifices, too, exhibit in their style
something of the sturdy pride of their founders,
presenting less of ornament and decoration
than of domineering height and massive
solidity, and striking the visitor rather by
their strength than their elegance. On the
whole, Bruges reminded me strongly of
Pisa, and some of the towns of northern
Italy, whose history and decline are singularly
similar to its own. The air of its
edifices and buildings is the same, and
there is around it a similar appearance of
desertion rather than decay—though in
Bruges the retirement and solitude which
was, till recently, its characteristic, has
been much invaded by the concourse of
strangers whom the railroad brings hourly
to visit it.</p>

<p>Bruges, in the olden time, was indebted
for its political importance to its being the
most ancient capital of the Low Countries,
and one of the residences of the old “Foresters
of Flanders,” and of that illustrious line
of sovereign Counts and Dukes, whose dynasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
extends almost from Charlemagne to 
Charles V, and whose exploits enrich the
annals of the crusades and form the theme
of the romancers and minstrels of the middle
ages. Of the palaces of these stormy
potentates, scarcely a vestige now remains,
except a few dilapidated walls of the “Princenhof,”
in which Charles le Téméraire
espoused Margaret of York, the sister of
our Edward IV, and in which, also, his
interesting daughter, Mary of Valois, Duchess
of Burgundy, married Maximilian of
Austria, son to Frederick IV—that “portentous
alliance,” which subsequently
brought the Netherlands under the dominion
of the Emperor, and consigned them,
on the abdication of Charles V, to the tender
mercies of the sanguinary Philip of
Spain. At her nuptials, the Duke of Bavaria
acted as proxy for the imperial bridegroom,
and according to the custom of the
period, passed the night with the young
duchess, each reposing in full dress, with
a sword placed between them, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
presence of four armed archers of the
guard.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the same square,
stands, likewise, the house, now an estaminet,
in which her husband, Maximilian,
then King of the Romans, was, after her
death, confined by the citizens of Bruges,
in 1487, in consequence of a dispute as to
the custody of his two children, in whom,
by the death of their mother, was vested
the right to the sovereignty of Flanders.
In spite of the fulminations of the Pope,
and the march of the Emperor, his father,
with an army of forty thousand men, the
undaunted burghers held him a prisoner
for six weeks, till he submitted to their
terms and took an oath to respect their
rights, and exact no vengeance for their
violent demonstration in their assertion.</p>

<p>Bruges was, likewise, upon two occasions
the asylum of the exiled monarchs of
England; once when Edward IV took refuge
there, when flying from the Earl of
Warwick’s rebellion; and, again, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Charles II, in his exile, occupied a house
in the Place d’Armes, at the corner of the
Rue St. Amand. It is now the shop of a
tailor.</p>

<p>But all our recollections of Bruges are
crowded with associations of the poetry of
history; and the very names of her
chieftains, Baldwin of the Iron Arm, Robert
of Jerusalem, Margaret of Constantinople,
Philip the Handsome, and Louis of
Crecy, call up associations of chivalry, gallantry
and romance.</p>

<p>From the thirteenth century to the close
of the sixteenth, Bruges was at once in the
plentitude of her political power and the
height of her commercial prosperity. As
the furs and iron of the north were not yet
carried by sea round the Baltic, and the
wealth of India still poured through the
Red Sea into Genoa and Venice, Bruges
became one of the great entrepots where they
were collected, in order to be again distributed
over Western Europe; and with
Dantzic, Lubeck, Hamburg, and a few other
trading cities of the west, Bruges became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
one of the leading commandaries of the
Hanseatic League. The idea of marine
insurances was first acted upon at Bruges
in the thirteenth century, and the first
exchange for the convenience of merchants
was built there in the century following.</p>

<p>Her manufactures were equally celebrated
with her traffic and her trade. Her tapestries
were the models, and, indeed, the progenitors
of the Gobelins, which were established
in France by a native of Bruges,
under the patronage of Henry IV; and the
fame of her woolstaplers and weavers has
been perpetuated in the order of the Golden
Fleece, the emblem of which was selected
by Philip the Good in honour of the artizans
of Bruges.</p>

<p>It was a native of Bruges, Beham, who,
fifty years before the enterprise of Columbus,
ventured to “tempt the western
main,” and having discovered the Azores,
first led the way to the awakening of a new
hemisphere.</p>

<p>Of the luxury of her citizens in this age,
many traditions are still extant; such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
that of the wife of Philip the Fair exclaiming
on finding herself eclipsed in the splendour
of her dress by the ladies of her
capital:—“<i>Je croyais être ici la seule reine,
mais j’en vois plus de cent autour de moi!</i>”
A similar story is recorded of their husbands,
who when they returned to Paris
with their Duke, Louis le Mael, to do homage
to King John, the successor of
Philip of Valois, felt affronted on finding
that no cushions had been provided for
them at a banquet to which they were
invited by the King, and having sat upon
their embroidered cloaks, declined to resume
them on departing, saying:—“<i>Nous
de Flandre, nous ne sommes point accoutumés
où nous dinons, d’emporter avec nous les
coussins.</i>”</p>

<p>All this has now passed away, other nations
have usurped her foreign commerce,
and her own rivals at home have extinguished
her manufactures. But still in
her decline, Bruges wears all the air of
reduced aristocracy; her poor are said to
be frightfully numerous in proportion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
her population, but they are not, as elsewhere,
ostentatiously offensive; except a
few decrepid objects of compassion, by the
door of the cathedral, we did not see a
beggar in the streets. The dress of the
lower orders is remarkable for its cleanliness
and neatness, and an universal costume
with the females of the bourgeoisie,
was a white muslin cap with a lace border
and a long black silk cloak, with a hood
which covered the head, and is evidently a
remnant of the Spanish mantilla. There
was, also, a cheerful decorum in the carriage
of the people whom we met in the
streets, that one felt to be in accordance
with the gravity of such a venerable old
place, as if the streets were consecrated
ground:</p>

<p>By the way, it is an instance of the abiding
hatred with which the people of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Low Countries must have, traditionally, regarded
their former tyrants, that so few
traces of their dominion or their presence
should now be discernible in the country
which they so long blasted with their presence.
Occasionally, one recognizes in
the olive complexion and coal black eye of
the Fleming, the evidences of her southern
blood; and at Ghent and Brussels there are
one or two families who still bear the names
of Alcala, Rey and Hermosa, and a few
others who trace their origin to Castilian
ancestors; but there are no striking monuments
now existing of a people, who so long
exercised a malignant influence over the
destinies of Flanders.</p>

<p>It is true that but a short period, about
a century and a half, elapsed from the death
of Mary of Burgundy to that of Albert and
Isabella, but it is equally true, that for
generations before, the princes of the Low
Countries had sought their matrimonial
alliances at the court of Spain; and under
Philip the Handsome and Charles V, when
the Netherlands were in the pride of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
prosperity, they afforded an alluring point
for the resort of the adventurers of that
country, and of the numbers who availed
themselves of the royal encouragement to
settle there; it is curious that not a mansion,
not a monument, or almost a remnant
should now be discernible.</p>

<p>In Bruges, as in most other catholic
cities, the chief depositaries of objects of
popular admiration are the churches; and
of these, the most attractive and remarkable
are the matchless sculptures in wood
which decorate the confessionals and
pulpits, and in the richness and masterly
workmanship of which, the specimens in
the Netherlands are quite unrivalled.
Bruges is rich in these. In the church of
Notre Dame, the pulpit is a superb work
of art of this description; chiselled in oak,
supported by groups of figures the size of
life, and decorated throughout with arabesques
and carvings of flowers and fruit
of the most charming execution. It is of
vast dimensions for such a work, reaching
from the floor almost to the gothic roof of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the building. In the same church there
are two confessionals of equal elegance,
each separated, as usual, into three apartments
by partitions, in front of each of
which are caryatides, which support the roof.</p>

<p>In the church of the Holy Saviour,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the grand organ presents another example
of this gorgeous carving; and in the little
chapel of St. Sang, which is possessed
of a few drops of <i>the genuine blood of our
Saviour</i>, periodically exhibited in its jewelled
shrine to the faithful, there is a pulpit, perhaps,
of better workmanship than taste, the
shell of which represents the terrestrial
globe, (orbis veteribus cognita), with a delineation
of those geographical outlines
which were known at the period of its
erection.</p>

<p>In works of art, the burghers of Bruges
seem to have been generous as well as ambitious
in adorning their city, so long as
its municipal affluence placed it within their
power to gratify their tastes. The churches,
are, therefore, rich in works of the <i>early</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Flemish school—the Van Eycks and Hans
Hemling, and Pourbus and their collaborators
and successors: but at the period
when the new Flemish school had arisen,
with Otto Vennius, and attained its eminence
under Rubens and Vandyk, Bruges
had already suffered her decline, the sun
of her prosperity had gone down, and she
possesses no works of their pencil. The
chief depositaries of paintings in the city,
are the church of St. Sauveur, the chapel
of the Hospital of St. John, and the Gallery
of the Museum near the Quai du
Miroir. The three collections present precisely
the same array of names, and the
same features of art, insipid and passionless
faces, figures harsh and incorrect in
drawing, finished with that elaborate care
which seems to have been at all times the
characteristic of the schools of both Flanders
and Holland, and gaudy, inharmonious
colours, upon a brilliant and generally
gilded ground, in the Byzantine style.
Except as mere antiquities, these pictures
have but little interest to any except the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
mere historian of the art. The collection
in St. Saveur I did not see, as it had been
removed in consequence of a recent fire,
but it seems from the lists to be rather extensive.</p>

<p>That in the <i>Museum</i> is numerous, but
monotonous and tiresome, for the reasons I
have mentioned, though Sir Joshua Reynolds
speaks with high approbation of some
beauties, I presume, it requires the eye of
an artist to discern them. The gallery
here contains, also, a statue, by Calloigne,
a native artist, of John Van Eyck, the
painter, called “John of Bruges,” to whom
has been ascribed the invention of painting
in oil. His claim to the discovery is, of
course, incorrect, as the mummy cases of
Egypt sufficiently attest, but his merit as
one of those, who, earliest and most successfully
applied it to the purposes of art, is
sufficiently indicated by a glance at his
pictures, and their comparison with the inferior
productions of his contemporaries in
Italy.</p>

<p>But the principal exhibition of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
masters of Bruges, is in the parlour of the
chapel at the ancient <i>Hospital of Saint John</i>.
Here the pride of the custodian are the
chef-d’œuvres of Hans Memling. Hemling
was a soldier and a roué, a prodigal and a
genius utterly unconscious of his power.
He ended a career of excesses by enlisting
in one of the military companies of Bruges,
his native city, and from the battle of
Nancy, whither he had followed Charles
the Rash, in 1477, he was carried, wounded
and dying, to the Hospital of St. John.
The skill of the leeches triumphed, however,
and Hans was restored to strength
and vigour, when, for want, perhaps, of
some other asylum, he spent ten years of
his subsequent life amongst his friends in
the hospital, and enriched its halls with the
choicest specimens of his art. These pictures
are of marvellous brilliancy, although
it is said, that Hemling rejected the use of
oil, which had been introduced by his contemporary
and rival, Van Eyck, and adhered
to the old plan of tempering his
colours with size and albumen. The artist,
too, has introduced into them portraits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
of the nuns and sisters of charity, who were
the attendants of the sick in the hospital—a
delicate and yet lasting memorial of his
gratitude for their kindnesses towards himself.</p>

<p>Amongst a number of portraits and scriptural
subjects, the gem of the collection is
a little, old-fashioned <i>cabinet</i>, probably intended
for the reception of relics, some
three feet long and broad in proportion,
covered with a conical lid, and the whole
divided into pannels, each containing a
scene from the legend of St. Ursula, and
the massacre of herself and her eleven
thousand virgins, by the Goths, at Cologne.
This curious little antique is so highly
prized, that it is shown under a glass cover,
and the directors of the hospital refused to
exchange it for a coffer of the same dimensions
in solid silver. The execution of the
paintings has all the characteristic faults
and beauties of its author, only the former
are less glaring from the small dimensions
of the figures. The faces of the ladies exhibit
a good perception of female beauty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and St. Ursula herself has her hair plaited
into braids and drawn behind her ear, much
in the fashion of the present time in
England.</p>

<p>The majority of the other pictures have
the folding doors which were peculiar to
all the painters of the Low Countries, till Rubens
latterly dispensed with the use, though
they are to be seen on his matchless “Descent
from the Cross,” and some others
of his pictures in the cathedral at Antwerp.
They served to close up the main composition
when folded across it; and as they are,
themselves, painted on both sides, so as to
exhibit a picture whether closed or open,
they had the effect of producing five compartments
all referring to the same subject, but
of which the four outward ones are, of
course, subsidiary to the grand design
within.</p>

<p>The hospital in which these pictures are
exhibited, is one of the best conducted
establishments of the kind I have ever seen.
Its attendants, in their religious costume, and
with their nun’s head-dresses, move about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
it with the quiet benevolence which accords
with their name, as “sisters of charity,”
and the lofty wards, with the white linen
of the beds, present in every particular an
example of the most accurate neatness and
cleanliness.</p>

<p>Both it and the churches I have named,
stand close by the station of the railway
by which the traveller arrives from Ghent
or from Ostend. Besides their curious old
paintings, the churches have little else remarkable;
they are chiefly built of brick, and
make no very imposing appearance. That
of the St. Sauveur, contains a statue in
marble attributed to Michael Angelo, and
though not of sufficient merit to justify the
supposition, is in all probability the work of
one of his pupils. The story says, that it
was destined for Genoa, but being intercepted
on its passage by a Dutch privateer,
was carried to Amsterdam, where it was
purchased by a merchant of Bruges, and
presented to his native city.</p>

<p>But the chief object of interest, and,
indeed, the grand lion of Bruges, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
tomb of Mary of Burgundy in a little
chapel of the same cathedral. The memory
of this amiable Princess, and her early fate
are associated with the most ardent feelings
of the Flemings; she was the last of their native
sovereigns, and at her decease, their principality
became swallowed up in the overgrown
dominion of the houses of Austria;
like Charlotte of England, she was snatched
from them in the first bloom of youth, she
died before she was twenty-five, in consequence
of a fall from her horse when
hawking, and the independance of her
country expired with her. Beside her, and
in a similar tomb, repose the ashes of her
bold and impetuous father, Charles the
Rash, which was constructed by order of
Philip of Spain. The chapel in which
both monuments are placed, was prepared
for their reception at the cost of Napoleon,
who, when he visited Belgium, with Maria
Louisa, in 1810, left a sum of money to
defray the expense of their removal. Both
tombs are of the same model, two rich
sarcophagi, composed of very dark stone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
ornamented with enamelled shields, and
surmounted by recumbent statues, in gilded
bronze, of the fiery parent and his gentle
daughter. The blazonry of arms upon
the innumerable shields which decorate
their monuments, and the long array of
titles which they record, bespeak the large
domains, which, by successive alliances, had
been concentrated in the powerful house of
Burgundy. The inscription above the
ashes of Charles the Rash, is as follows:</p>

<p>The sincere and unaffected sorrow of
those who raised a monument to the Princess,
is much more impressively bespoken in the
simple and natural language of its inscription.
After recapitulating the pompous
honours of her house, and her greatness as
a Queen, they have thus expressed affectionate
esteem for her as a woman and a wife.
“Five years she reigned as Lady of the
Low Countries, for four of which she lived
in love and great affection with my Lord,
her husband. She died deplored, lamented
and wept by her subjects, and by all who
knew her as was never Princess before.
Pray God for her soul. Amen.”</p>

<p>The most conspicuous object in Bruges,
both from a distance and within the walls, is
the lofty tower of an ancient building,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
called “Les Halles”—an edifice of vast
extent, whose original destination seems to
be but imperfectly known, but which, in all
probability, served as a depot for merchandize
during the palmy days of the Hanseatic
League, whilst in its ponderous tower were
deposited the ancient records of the city.
The lower buildings are now partly unoccupied,
and partly used for the purposes of a
covered market, and on the tower are stationed
the warders, who, night and day, look out for
fires in the streets of the city or the suburbs.
It contains, likewise, one of those
sweet carillons of bells, which, in their excellence,
seem to be peculiar to the Netherlands,
as in no other country that I am
aware of do their chimes approach to any
thing like harmonious music. In the tower
of Les Halles and some others in Belgium,
they are set in motion by a huge cylinder
with moveable keys, similar to those in a
barrel organ or a Geneva box. The tunes
are arranged and altered every year at
Easter, and the carillon, besides announcing
every hour, is played almost daily for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
amusement of the citizens. But besides
the mechanical arrangement, there are keys
which can be played on at pleasure, and
during our visit, the “chief musician”
commenced this feat, hammering with his
fists, defended first by strong leather, and
tramping with his heels, till every muscle
in his whole body seemed called into
action—an exercise very like that of
Falstaff’s recruit Bullfrog, when he “caught
a cold <i>in ringing in the king’s affairs</i> upon
the coronation day.”</p>

<p>The view from this tower is really surprising,
owing to the vast level plain in
which it stands, and which stretches to the
horizon without an undulation upon every
side; the view is only limited by the ability
of the eye to embrace it, and the sight is
bewildered with the infinity of villages,
towers, forests, canals and rivers which it
presents, taking in at one vast glance, the
German Ocean, the distant lines of Holland,
the towers of Ghent, and to the south,
the remote frontier of France. Its views,
like almost every thing else in the Netherlands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
are peculiar to itself, and in the 
repose and richness of cultivated beauty,
have not a parallel in any country of Europe.</p>

<p>In a small square adjoining that in which
stands the tower of Les Halles, are two
other ancient buildings of equal interest.
The <i>palais de justice</i> occupies the site of
the old “palace of the Franc or liberty of
Bruges.” It contains in one of its apartments,
(the others are chiefly modern,)
a remarkable mantel-piece of carved
oak, covering the entire side of the hall,
and consisting of a number of statues the
size of life, let into niches decorated with
the most elaborate and beautiful carvings,
and surmounted by the armorial bearings
of Burgundy, Brabant, and Flanders. This
singular specimen of the arts, dates from
the reign of Charles V. and contains
statues of the Emperor himself, with Maximilian,
and Mary of Burgundy to his left
hand; on his right, those of Charles le
Téméraire, and his Lady Margaret of York.
These specimens of the perfection to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
this description of modelling has attained
amongst the Flemings, must really be seen,
in order to be sufficiently comprehended.</p>

<p>The other building adjoining is the
<i>Hotel de Ville</i>, a small, but elegant example
of the gothic architecture in the fourteenth
century. The many niches which
now stand empty at each compartment of
its front, were formerly filled with statues
of the native Princes of Flanders and Burgundy,
to the number of thirty-three; numerous
shields, charged with arms surmounted
the principal windows, and on a
little balcony in front, the Dukes, on the
occasion of their inauguration, made oath
to respect the rights and privilege of their
subjects. But in 1792, the soldiers of the
French directory, under Dumourier, in the
“fine frenzy” of republicanism, tore down
these ancient monuments of the former history
of Bruges, as “the images of tyrants”
and pounding them to dust, flung them upon
a pile composed of fragments of the gallows
and the scaffold, and ordered it to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
kindled by the public executioner. The
grand hall in the Hotel de Ville is occupied
as a library, and contains a large and
valuable collection of books and manuscripts.</p>

<p>Bruges was the birth-place of Berken, who
discovered the art of polishing the diamond,
and, as if the secret were still confined to
the craft, (in fact it was for a length of time
a secret amongst the jewellers of the Low
Countries), one still sees over many a door
in Bruges, the sign-board of the “<span class="err" title="original: Diaman">Diamant</span>-zetter,”
who resides within.</p>

<p>In other cities, one would feel as if compiling
a guide-book in noting these particulars
of Bruges; but here it is different, as
every spot, however trifling, is exalted by
some traditionary association with the
past. “In the thirteenth century,” says the
Hand-book, “the ambassadors of twenty
states had their hotels within the walls of
the city, and the commercial companies of
seventeen nations were settled and carried
on their traffic within its walls. It became
the resort of traders of Lombardy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Venice, who carried hither the merchandize
of Italy and India, to be exchanged for the
produce of Germany and the north. The
argosies of Genoa and Constantinople, frequented
her harbour, and her warehouses
were stored with the wool of England, the
linen of Belgium, and the silk of Persia.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Can any one read this record of the past,
and comparing it with the desolation of the
present, avoid being reminded of the magnificent
description and denunciation of
Tyre, by Ezekiel. “Fine linen from Egypt
was that which thou spreadest forth for thy
sails; the inhabitants of Zidon were thy mariners;
the men of Persia were thine army;
and they of Gammadin were on thy towers,
and hung their shields upon thy walls to
make thy beauty perfect. Tarshish was
thy merchant, and with iron and with tin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
they traded in thy fairs. Syria gave thee
emeralds and broidered work, and coral, and
agate. Judah traded in thy markets in
honey, and oil, and balm. Damascus in the
wine of Hebron and white wool. Arabia
occupied with thee in lambs and in goats;
and the merchants of Sheba brought thee
precious stones and gold. * * * They
that handle the oar, the mariner and pilots
of the sea, shall come down from thy ships;
they shall stand upon the land, and in their
wailing they shall cry, what city is like unto
Tyre, like unto the destroyed in the midst
of the waters?”</p>

<p>Of all her active pursuits, Bruges now retains
no remnant except the manufacture of
lace, to which even her ancient fame has
ceased to give a prestige; and it is exported
to France to be sold under the name of <i>Point
de Valenciennes</i>. Mechlin, Antwerp, Ypres
and Grammont share with her in its production;
and it is interesting to observe
how this mignon and elegant art, originally,
perhaps, but the pastime of their young
girls and women, has survived all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
storms and vicissitudes which have from
time to time suspended or disturbed the
other national occupations of the Belgians,
and now enables the inhabitants of their superannuated
cities, in the ruin of their own
fortunes, to support themselves, as it were,
upon the dower of their females. France,
in the time of Colbert, seduced the manufacture
to establish itself at Paris by actual
gifts of money; and England, emulous of
sharing in it, purchased the lace of Belgium
to sell to Europe as her own, and
made by it such a reputation, that <i>English
lace</i> is still a popular name for a particular
description made at Brussels!</p>

<p>The exquisitely fine thread which is made
in Hainault and Brabant for the purpose
of being worked into lace, has occasionally
attained a value almost incredible. A
thousand to fifteen hundred francs is no
unusual price for it by the pound, but some
has actually been spun by hand of so exquisite
a texture, as to be sold at the rate
of ten thousand francs, or upwards of £400,
for a single pound weight. Schools have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
established to teach both the netting of the
lace and drawing of designs by which to work
it, and the trade, at the present moment, is
stated to be in a more flourishing condition
than it has been ever known before, even in
the most palmy days of the Netherlands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bruges</span> has the reputation of being an
economical residence for persons of limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
fortune, but I have reason to believe it does
not fully merit it. I have understood, that
at the termination of the war, a large mansion
with every appurtenance, was to have
been had for twenty-five pounds a year,
but the concourse of English, and the influx
of strangers, has now placed it, in this
respect, pretty much upon a par with other
places of the continent.</p>

<p>We dined at an excellent table-d’hôte
at the Hôtel de Commerce, the only inconvenience
being the early hour, 2 o’clock,
but this, and even earlier hours for dinner,
we became, not only reconciled to, but almost
to prefer before leaving Germany.
To the prevalence of these tables-d’hôte in
every town and village of the continent, must,
no doubt, be ascribed much of that social
feeling and easy carriage which characterise
the people of almost every country in Europe
except our own. Being frequented by persons
of all ranks, they lead to an assimilation
of manners and of taste, which must
be conducive to general refinement; and
by an interchange of opinions and a diffusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of intelligence during the two or three 
hours of daily intercourse, they must contribute
to a diffusion of information, and a
better understanding between all classes.</p>

<p>In England, with our present sectional
ideas and well defined grades, their introduction
would be impossible, or if attempted,
would only serve to make more
distinct and compact the divisions into
which society is parcelled out. And yet,
how desirable would it be that some successful
expedient could be discovered to
produce a more frequent intercourse between
these numerous castes, and to soften down
these Hindoo prejudices, which are an unquestionable
source of insecurity and weakness
in England. It is to this, that in a great
degree is to be ascribed the virulence of
political jealousies, and the intense hatred
of political parties. So long as wealth is constituted
the great standard which is to
adjust conventional precedence, affluence
and intelligence must form one exclusive
race, of whose feelings, habits, objects and
desires, poverty and ignorance, as they <i>can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
know nothing</i>, may be easily persuaded to
believe them hostile and destructive to
their own; and even mediocrity of rank,
as it stands aloof from either, will continue
to look with alarm and jealousy upon both.</p>

<p>Were it practicable, by any salutary expedient,
to enable the humble and laborious
<i>to perceive for themselves</i>, that the enjoyments
and habits of the rich are not necessarily
antagonist to their own, it would at
once paralyze the strength of the demagogue
and the incendiary. Religious bigotry
and political malignity, like sulphur
and nitre, are explosive only when combined
with the charcoal of ignorance.</p>

<p>The railroad from Bruges to Ghent,
runs for the entire way within view, and
frequently along the bank of the canal
which connects the two cities, and which
occasionally presents greater beauty than
one is prepared to expect; its waters folded
over with the broad leaves of the water
lilly, and variegated with its flowers, and
those of the yellow bog bean; and its steep
banks covered with the tassels of the flowering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
rush. The road passed through numerous 
copses, cultivated for firewood and
planted with the oak, the chesnut and the
weeping birch, with here and there broad
patches of firs and hornbeam. But the
beauty of the long lines of ornamental
trees which enclose the road and sometimes
border the canals in Flanders, is much impaired
by the fashion of pollarding their
tops for the purpose of fuel.</p>

<p>One misses, also, the numerous seats and
mansions of the landed gentry to which
we are familiarized in travelling in our own
country, “the happy homes of England,”
that constitute the rich luxuriance of a
British landscape. But here, their erection
is discountenanced by the law against
primogeniture, by which the property of
the individual is compulsorily divided
amongst his heirs; and, at former
periods, their absence may, perhaps, be
ascribed to the insecurity of the country,
perpetually visited with war and all its accessories,
so that men found their only
safety within the walls of their fortified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
towns. In the neighbourhood of Ghent,
however, they are more frequent than in
any other district of Belgium which I have
seen, an evidence, perhaps, of the more
abundant wealth of its successful manufactures
and merchants.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of all the villages and
suburbs, each house is provided with a garden,
richly stocked with flowers, (amongst
which the multitude of dahlias was quite
remarkable), and surrounded, not by a
fence, but more frequently, in gardens of
any extent, by a broad dyke of deep water,
covered with lillies and aquatic plants.
Every inch of ground seemed to have been
subjected to the spade, and with a more
than Chinese economy of the soil, made
to contribute either to the decoration or
the support of the owner’s dwelling.</p>

<p>After passing the hamlets of Bloemendael
(the valley of flowers), and Aeltre, we
came in sight of Ghent, situated on a
considerable elevation above the water of
the Scheldt (pronounced <i>Skeld</i>), the Lys,
the Lieve, and the Moer, which meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
around its base, and with their communicating
branches and canals, divide the city
into six-and-twenty islets, connected by
upwards of eighty bridges of wood or stone.
Its towers and steeples are discernible for
some miles before it is reached, mingled
with the tall chimnies of its numerous
manufactories, which mark it as the Manchester
of Belgium.</p>

<p>The court-yard of the station was filled
with a crowd of omnibuses, fiacres and
<i>vigilantes</i>, an improvement upon the cabs of
London, and a drive of a few minutes
brought us to the Cauter, or Place d’Armes,
where, following the direction of the Hand-book,
we stopped at the Hôtel de la Poste,
a spacious house, kept by a M. Oldi, who,
we were told, was son to a Baroness of the
same name, who figured on the occasion of
the trial of Queen Caroline.</p>

<h3>GHENT.</h3>

<p>My anxiety was to learn something of
the actual state of manufacturing industry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
in Belgium, and Ghent, its principal seat
and centre, presented the most favourable
opportunities. Our introductions were numerous,
but my chief obligations are to
<i>M. Grenier</i>, one of the most intelligent and
accomplished men of business whom it has
been my good fortune to meet. He had
been formerly an officer in the Imperial
Guard of Napoleon, whilst Belgium was a
province of the empire, but on the return
of peace, in 1815, betook himself to pursuits
of commerce, and is now connected
with some of the most important manufacturing
and trading establishments of Belgium.
I owe a similar acknowledgment
for the polite attentions of <i>M. de Smet de
Naeyer</i>,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> an eminent manufacturer, and one
of the officers of the Chamber of Commerce
and of the Conseil de Prud’hommes
at Ghent.</p>

<p>The latter body which is an institution,
originally French, was introduced in Belgium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
by a decree of Napoleon in 1810. It 
is a board formed jointly of employers and
workmen, elected by annual sections, and
discharging all its functions, not only gratuitously
as regards the public, but without
payment to its own members, beyond the
mere expenditure of the office, and a moderate
salary to a secretary. Its duties have
reference to the adjustment of the mutual
intercourse between workmen and their
masters in every branch of manufacture,
the prevention of combinations, the performance
of contracts, the regulation of
apprenticeship, and the effectual administration
of the system of <i>livrets</i>—a species of
permanent diploma, which the artisan received
on the termination of his pulpilage,
signed by the master to whom he had been
articled, and sealed by the President of the
Conseil de Prud’hommes. Without the
production of his <i>livret</i>, no tradesman can
be received into employment; and in it
are entered all his successive discharges
and acquittances with his various masters.
The powers of fining and of forfeiture exercised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
by the conseil, are summary up to a 
certain amount, and in cases of graver importance,
there is a resort to the correctional
police.</p>

<p>But the main functions of the Conseil de
Prud’hommes are the prevention of any
invasion of the peculiar rights of any
manufacturer, or the counterfeit imitation
of his particular marks; and especially
the protection of the copyright of all designs
and productions of art for the decoration
of manufactures. With this view,
every proprietor of an original design,
whether for working in metals or on woven
fabrics, is empowered to deposit a copy of
it in the archives of the council, enveloped
in a sealed cover, and signed by himself;
and to receive in return a certificate of its
enrolment, and the date of reception. At
the same time, he is called upon to declare
the length of time for which he wishes to
secure to himself the exclusive right of its
publication, whether for one, two, or three
years, or for ever, and in either case, a
trifling fee is demanded, in no instance exceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
a franc for each year the protection 
is claimed, or ten for a perpetuity.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In
the event of any dispute as to originality
or proprietorship, the officer of the council
is authorized to break the seal, and his
testimony is conclusive as to the date and
circumstances of the deposit.</p>

<p>The effect of this simple and inexpensive
tribunal has been found so thoroughly
effectual, that the most equitable security
has been established for designs of every
description applicable to works of taste, and
the <i>intellectual property</i> of a pattern has
been as thoroughly vindicated to its inventor
through the instrumentality of the
register of the Prud’hommes, as his
<i>material property</i>, in the article on which it
is to be impressed, is secured to him by the
ordinary law. In fact, the whole operation
of the institution at Ghent has proved so
beneficial to manufactures universally, that
by a <i>projet de loi</i> of 1839, similar boards
are about to be established in all the leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
towns and cities, as Liege, Brussels, 
Courtrai, Antwerp, Louvain, Mons, Charleroi,
Verviers, and the manufacturing districts,
generally, throughout Belgium.</p>

<p>One of our first visits was to a mill for
spinning linen yarn, recently constructed
by a joint stock company, called <i>La Société
de la Lys</i>, in honour, I presume, of the
Flemish river on which it is situated, and
which is celebrated on the continent for the
extraordinary suitability of its waters for
the preparation of flax. Belgium, from the
remotest period, even, it is said, before the
Christian era, has been celebrated for its
manufacture of clothing of all descriptions.
It was from Belgium that England derived
her first knowledge of the weaving of wool;
damask has been made there since the time
of the Crusades, when the soldiers of Godfrey
of Bouillon and of Count Baldwin,
brought the art from Damascus; and to the
present hour, the very name of “<i>Holland</i>”
is synonymous with linen, and the cloth so
called, has for centuries been woven principally
in Flanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>Under the government of Austria, the
manufacture seems to have attained its
acmé of prosperity in the Netherlands, her
exports of linen, in 1784, amounting to
27,843,397 yards, whilst at the present
moment, with all her increase of population
and discoveries in machinery, she
hardly surpasses thirty millions. Again,
under the continental system of Napoleon,
from 1805 to 1812, it attained a high degree
of prosperity, which sensibly decreased
after the events of 1814, when English produce
came again into active competition
with it.</p>

<p>The cultivation of flax is still, however,
her staple employment, one acre in every
eighty-six of the whole area of Belgium,
being devoted to its growth. In peculiar
districts, such as Courtrai and St. Nicolas,
so much as one acre in twenty is given to
it; and in the Pays de Waes, it amounts
so high as one in ten. Every district of
Belgium, in fact, yields flax, more or less,
except Luxembourg and Limburg, where it
has been attempted, but without success;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
but of the entire quantity produced, Flanders
alone furnishes three-fourths, and the
remaining provinces, one. The quality of
the flax, too, seems, independently of local
superiority in its cultivation, to be essentially
dependent upon the nature of the
soil in which it is sown. From that around
Ghent, no process of tillage would be sufficient
to raise the description suitable to
more costly purposes; that of the Waloons
yields the very coarsest qualities; Courtrai
those whose strength is adapted for thread;
and Tournai alone furnished the fine and
delicate kinds, which serve for the manufacture
of lace and cambric.</p>

<p>Of the quantity of dressed flax prepared
in Belgium, calculated to amount to about
eighteen millions of kilogrammes, five millions
were annually exported to England
and elsewhere, on an average of eight
years, from 1830 to 1839. According to
the returns of the Belgian custom-houses,
the export has been as follows—from 1830
to 1839.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<p>It is important to observe the steady
increase of the English demand since
1834. The remainder is reserved for home
manufacture into thread and cloth, and it
is estimated by M. Briavionne, that the
cultivation of this one article alone, combining
the value of the raw material with
the value given to it by preparation, in its
various stages from flax to linen cloth,
produces annually to Belgium, an income
of 63,615,000 francs.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Belgium possesses no source of national
wealth at all to be put into comparison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
with this, involving as it does, the concentrated
profits both of the raw material and
its manufacture, and, at the present moment,
the attention of the government and
the energies of the nation are directed to
its encouragement in every department,
with an earnestness that well bespeaks their
intimate sense of its importance.</p>

<p>Nor are the prudent anxieties of the Belgium
ministry on this point without serious
and just grounds. Their ability to enter into
competition with England in the production
of either yarn or linen cloth, arises
solely from the fortunate circumstance to
which I have just alluded, that not only
do they themselves produce the raw material
for their own manufactures, but it is they,
who, likewise, supply it to their competitors,
almost at their own price. <i>Such is the superiority
of Belgian flax, that whilst, in some
instances, it has brought so high a price as
£220 per ton, and generally ranges from £80
to £90; not more than £90 has in any instance
that I ever heard of, been obtained for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
British, and its ordinary average does not
exceed £50.</i></p>

<p>The elements of their trade are, therefore,
two-fold, the growth of flax, and secondly,
its conversion by machinery into yarn and
cloth. In the latter alone, from the relative
local circumstances of the two countries,
it is utterly impossible that Belgium
could successfully maintain the contest
with England, with her inferior machinery,
her more costly fuel, and her circumscribed
sale; but aided by the other happy advantage
of being enabled to supply herself with the
raw material at the lowest possible rate, and
her rivals at the highest, she is in possession
of a position of the very last importance.</p>

<p>But, should any circumstance arise to
alter this relative position, should England
wisely apply herself to the promotion of
such an improvement in the cultivation and
dressing of her flax at home as would
render it in quality equal to that for which
she is now dependent for her supply from
abroad—should India or her own colonies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
betake themselves to its production, or
should some other country, adopting the
processes of Belgium, supplant her in the
market, and thus reduce her competition
with England to a mere contest with machinery,
the linen trade of Belgium could
not by any possibility sustain the struggle,
and her staple manufacture for centuries
would pass, at once, into the hands of her
rivals.</p>

<p>Conscious of their critical situation in
this respect, the King of Holland, during his
fifteen years’ administration of the Netherlands,
bestowed a care upon the encouragement
and improvement of their mechanical
skill, which may have, perhaps, been carried
to an unwise extreme; and with a
similar anxiety for the maintenance of their
ascendancy in the other department, the
ministers of King Leopold have devoted
a sedulous attention to the cultivation
of flax; and the very week of my
arrival at Ostend, a commission had just
returned from England, whose inquiries had
been specially directed to the question of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
imposing restrictions upon its exportation.</p>

<p>Much of the uneasiness of the government
upon this head, arises, at the present
moment, from the necessity of promoting
vigorously the spinning by machinery, and,
at the same time, the difficulty of finding
employment for the thousands who now
maintain themselves by the old system of
spinning by hand, and whom the successful
introduction of the new process will
deprive of their ordinary means of subsistence.
Although this is one of those complaints
to which we have long been familiarized
in England, and which the people
of this country have, at length, come to
perceive is not amongst—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“Those ills that kings or laws can cause or cure,”</p>
</div>

<p class="noin">the alarm and perplexity of the Belgians,
and their earnest expostulation on finding
their employment suddenly withdrawn,
have caused no little embarrassment to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
own government; and a formidable party,
both in the country and in the House of
Representatives, have been gravely consulting
as to the best means of securing a
continuance of their “ancient industry” to
the hand-spinners at home, by restricting
the export of flax to be spun by machinery
abroad!</p>

<p>The practicability of this, and the propriety
of imposing a duty upon all flax
shipped for England, was understood to be
the subject of inquiry by the commission
despatched by the Chambers to England,
which consisted of Count d’Hane, a member
of the upper house, M. Couls, the
representative for the great linen district of
St. Nicolas, and M. Briavionne, a successful
writer upon Belgian commerce, and one
or two other gentlemen connected with the
linen trade.</p>

<p>The application of machinery to the manufacture
of linen yarn, though comparatively
recent in its introduction into Belgium,
has, nevertheless, made a surprising
progress, and bids fair, if unimpeded, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
maintain a creditable rivalry with Great
Britain. The offer by Napoleon, in 1810,
of a reward of a million of francs for the
discovery of a process by which linen could
be spun into yarn with the same perfection
as cotton, naturally gave a stimulus to all
the artisans of the empire, and almost simultaneously
with its promulgation, a manufacturer
of Belgium, called Bawens, announced
his application of the principle of
spinning through water, which is now in
universal use. The old system of dry spinning,
however, still obtained and was persevered
in till superseded, at a very recent
period, by the invention of Bawens, improved
by all the subsequent discoveries in
England and France.</p>

<p>The seat of the manufacture, at present,
is at Ghent and Liege, and is confined to
a very few extensive establishments, projected
by joint stock companies, or Sociétés
Anonymes,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> for the formation of which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
there has latterly been almost a mania in
Belgium. Four of these establishments,
projected between 1837 and 1838, proposed
to invest a capital amounting amongst the
whole, to no less than fourteen millions of
francs. One of them at Liege, perfected its
intention and is now in action. A second,
at Malines (Mechlin), was abandoned
after the buildings had been erected, and
the other two at Ghent, are still only
in process of completion. Besides these,
there is a third at Ghent, in the hands
of an individual, calculated for 10,000
spindles.</p>

<p>That which we visited belonging to <i>La
Société de la Lys</i>, may be taken as a fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
illustration of the progress which the art
has made in Belgium, as the others are all
constructed on similar models, and with the
same apparatus in all respects. It was originally
calculated for 15,000 spindles, but of
these not more than one third are yet erected,
and in motion, and but 5,000 others are in
preparation. The steam engines were made
in England, by Messrs. Hall, of Dartford,
on the principle known as Wolf’s patent,
which, using two cylinders, combines both
a high and low pressure, and is wrought
with one half to one third the fuel
required for the engines, in ordinary use in
England,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> an object of vast importance in a
country where coals are so expensive as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
are in Belgium.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The machinery is all made
at the Phœnix works in Ghent, the preparatory
portions of it are excellent, and exhibit
all the recent English improvements, and
in roving they use the new spiral frames.
But the spinning rooms show the Belgian
mechanics to be still much behind those of
Leeds and Manchester, as evinced by the
clumsiness and imperfect finish of the
frames, although they were still producing
excellent work; the yarn we saw being of
good quality, but of a coarse description,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and intended for home consumption, 
and for the thread-makers of Lisle. The
quantity produced, per day, was quite equal
to that of English spinners,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and their
wages much the same as those paid in Ireland,
and somewhat less than the English.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, the linen trade of Belgium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
notwithstanding its extensive preparation
of machinery, and the extraordinary demand
for its flax, must be regarded as in
anything but a safe or a permanent position.
In those stronger articles which can be
made from flax of English growth, the
English considerably undersell her already;
an important trade is, at this moment, carried
on in the north of Ireland in exporting
linen goods to Germany, whence they were
formerly imported into England, and whence
they are still sent into Belgium, where the
damask trade of Courtrai, which has been
perpetually declining since 1815, is now, all
but superseded by the weavers of Saxony
and Herrnhut; and the tickens of Turnhout,
by those woven from the strong thread of
Brunswick.</p>

<p>The contemplated measure of the French
government, to impose a heavy duty on
the importation of linen-yarn, will, if persevered
in, be most prejudicial to the
spinners of Belgium, as more or less, it
must inevitably diminish their consumption.
On the other hand, as England
herself may be said to grow no flax for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
own manufacture, and that of Ireland is
not only far inferior in quality to the Dutch
and Belgian, but inadequate to her own consumption,
and every year increasing in demand
and rising in price,—so long as Great
Britain is thus dependant upon her own rivals
for a supply of the raw material to feed her
machinery, at an expense of from 8 to 10
per cent, for freight and charges, in addition
to its high first cost, and whilst she must,
at the same time, compete with them in
those continental markets, which are open
to them both, the spinning mills of Belgium
cannot but be regarded otherwise than as
formidable opponents. Nor is this apprehension
diminished by the fact, that Belgium,
which a few years since had no
machinery for spinning yarn, except what
she obtained from other countries, or could
smuggle from England at a serious cost, is
now enabled to manufacture her own, and
has all the minerals, metals, and fuel within
herself, which combined with industry and
skilled labour, are essential to bring it to
perfection. For the present, the English
manufacturer, has a protection in the cost of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
his machinery alone—the factory of the
<i>Société de la Lys</i> cost £80,000 to erect, which
supposing its 10,000 spindles to be in action,
would be £8 per spindle, and as only the one
half of these are at present employed, the
actual cost is sixteen pounds; whilst an extensive
mill can be erected in Ireland for
from £4 to £5, and in England for even less.
The difference of interest upon such
unequal investments, must be a formidable
deduction from the actual profits of the
Belgians.</p>

<p>We returned to our Hotel by a shady
promenade along the <i>Coupure</i>, which connects
the waters of the Lys with the canal
of Bruges, the banks of which planted with a
triple row of tall trees, form one of the most
fashionable lounges and drives in Ghent.
Opening upon it are the gardens of the
Casino, a Grecian building of considerable
extent, constructed in 1836 for the two
botanical and musical societies of Ghent,
and, in which, the one holds its concerts,
and the other its spring and autumn exhibition
of flowers. At the rear of the building
is a large amphitheatre with seats cut from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the mossy bank and planted with flowers,
where the <i>Société de St. Cecile</i> give their Concerts
d’Eté, which are held in the open air,
in summer, and at which as many as six
thousand persons have occasionally been
accommodated.</p>

<p>In the rearing of flowers, Belgium and
more especially Ghent, has outrivalled the
ancient florists of Holland, the city is
actually environed with gardens and green-houses,
and those of the Botanical Society,
are celebrated throughout Europe for their
successful cultivation of the rarest exotics.
At Ghent their sale has, in fact, become an
important branch of trade; plants to the
value of a million and a half of francs having
been exported annually, on account of the
gardeners in the vicinity; and it is no
unusual thing to see in the rivers, vessels
freighted entirely with Camellias, Azaleas,
and Orange trees, which are sent to all
parts of Europe, even to Russia by the
florists of Ghent.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the city, without
being highly picturesque, is to a
stranger, of the most agreeable I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
to have seen. It does not present 
in the mass of its houses and buildings, that
uniform air of grave antiquity which belongs
to those of Bruges, the greater
majority of the streets having been often
rebuilt and modernized, as well as from the
effects of civic commotions, as to suit the
exigencies of trade and manufactures, which,
when they deserted the rest of Belgium,
seem to have concentrated themselves here.
Its modern houses are almost all constructed
on the Italian model, with ample
<i>portes-cochers</i>, spacious court yards, lofty
staircases, tall windows, and frequently
frescoes and bas-reliefs, to decorate the
exterior.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Almost every house is furnished
with an <i>espion</i>, a small plate of looking-glass
fixed outside the window, at such an
angle, that all that is passing in the street
is seen by those inside, without their appearing
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>Here and there upon the quays and in
the narrower streets, there are to be found
the gloomy old residences of the “Men
of Ghent,” now converted into inns or
ware-rooms, with their sharp tilted roofs,
high stepped gables, abutting on the
street, fantastic chimneys, and mullioned
windows, sunk deep into the walls.
And turning some sudden corner in a narrow
passage obstructed by lumbering
waggons, drawn by oxen, one finds himself
in front of some huge old tower, or venerable
belfry, covered with gothic sculpture,
and stretching up to the sky till he has to
bend back his head to descry the summit of
it. One singular old building on the Quai
aux Herbes, remarkable for its profusion
of Saxon arches and stone carvings, was
the Hall of the Watermen, whose turbulent
insurrection under John Lyon, is detailed
with quaint circumstantiality in the pages of
Froissart. But in the main, the streets of
Ghent are lively and attractive, and its
squares, spacious and planted with trees,
forming a striking contrast to the melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
brick and mortar buildings, that compose 
the manufacturing towns of England.
Here too, as in Manchester and Leeds, the
population seem all alive and active, but
instead of the serious and important earnestness
which one sees in every countenance
in Lancashire, the Gantois seems to go
about his affairs with cheerfulness and
alacrity, as if he was less employed on
business than amusement. The canals
are filled with heavily laden barges, and
the quays with long narrow waggons of
most primitive construction, into which
they unload their cargoes; whilst the number
of handsome private carriages, that one
sees in every thoroughfare, bespeak, at once,
the wealth and refinement of the population.
The shops are exceedingly good
though not particularly moderate in their
charges, and I was somewhat surprised to
see as an attraction on the sign boards at
the doors of the drapers and modistes, the
announcement that <i>Scotch</i> and <i>English goods</i>
were to be had within. Altogether the combination
of antique singularity with modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
comfort, commercial bustle, wealth, gaiety,
cleanliness, and vivacity, which is to
be seen at Ghent, cannot fail to strike the
most hurried traveller, and I doubt much
whether it is to be found in equal perfection,
in any other city of the continent of equal
extent.</p>

<p>Every quarter of the city exhibits traces of
the former wealth of the burghers, and every
building has some tradition characteristic
of the fiery turbulence of this little municipal
republic. Bruges and Ghent are, in
this regard, by far the most interesting
towns of Flanders. Brussels, Liege and
Ypres, are all of more modern date and
infinitively less historical importance, during
the stormy period of the Flemish annals
from the 12th to the 16th century. Ghent
was a fortified town a thousand years ago,
when its citadel was erected by Baldwin
of the Iron Arm, but it was only with the
rage for the Crusades, that the wealth and
importance of the towns of the Low Countries
arose; when the Seigneurs, in order
to obtain funds to equip them for their
expeditions to the Holy Land, released the inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of the towns from their vassalage, 
and sold to them the lands on which their
cities were built, and all the rights of self government,
privileges which subsequently assumed
the form of a corporate constitution.
Ghent thus obtained her independence
from Philip of Alsace, in 1178, and for the
first time secured the right of free assembly,
the election of her own provosts, a common
seal, and belfry, always an indispensable
accompaniment of civic authority, and important
in sounding the alarm and convoking
the citizens upon every emergency.</p>

<p>It was in consequence of these momentous
concessions, that whilst the lords
of the soil and their agrarian followers were
wasting their energies in distant war, or
subsisting by rapine and violence against
one another, the inhabitants of the towns,
secured within their walls and fortified
places, were enabled to devote themselves
to manufactures and to commerce, and
thus to concentrate in their own hands, the
largest proportion, by far, of the monied
wealth of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>But, coupled with their high privileges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
there were also some restrictions, to which
we of to-day are indebted for the vast and
magnificent edifices which the burghers of
these flourishing communities have left for
our wonder and admiration. The rights
accorded to them by their Seigneurs were
rigidly confined to the limits of their own
walls, no free burgher could purchase or
hold landed estate beyond the circuit of his
municipality; and thus, whilst driven to
accumulate capital in the pursuit of trade
and traffic, they were equally constrained to
invest it, not in land, like the retired merchants
of modern times, but in the construction
of these vast palaces and private
mansions, and in the decorations of their
dwellings, and the adornment of their cities.</p>

<p>It is to this political circumstance of
their position that we are to refer, in order
to account for the extent and splendour of
those ancient houses which we meet at
every turning in Bruges and Ghent—for
the costly carvings and sculptured decorations
of their fronts and interiors, and for
the quantity of paintings and ornaments in
which they abound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>The accumulation of their municipal resources,
too, required to be similarly disposed
of, and was applied to the erection of
their lofty belfries, the construction of those
gigantic towers which are elevated on all
their churches, and to the building of their
town halls and hôtels-de-ville, whose magnitude
and magnificence, are a matter,
equally of admiration of the genius which
designed, and astonishment at the wealth
which was necessary to erect them.</p>

<p>As the towns increased in prosperity and
wealth, money always sufficed to buy from
their sovereigns fresh privileges and powers,
and fresh accessions of territory to be added
to their municipal districts, till, at length,
the trades became so numerous as to enroll
themselves in companies, half civil and
half military, whilst all united to form
those trading commandaries or Hansen,
the spread of which, over the north-west of
Germany, forms so remarkable a feature
in the history of commerce and civilization.
Foremost in the Netherlands in the race
of prosperity was Ghent, which, within a
century from its enfranchisement, by Philip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of Alsace, rendered itself, in effect, the
capital of Flanders, with an extent and importance
even greater than the capital of
France, whence Charles V subsequently
ventured upon his bon mot, that he could
put all Paris in his <i>glove</i> “<i>dans mon gant</i>.”</p>

<p>But with this increase of prosperity, increased,
also, the troubles and cares of
these republican communities; their excessive
wealth at once engendering internal
rivalries and faction, and inviting foreign
cupidity and invasion. “Never,” says
Hallam, “did liberty wear a more unamiable
aspect than among the burghers of
the Netherlands, who abused the strength
she gave them, by cruelty and insolence.”
The entire history of Bruges and Ghent,
but especially the latter, is, in fact, a series
of wars, to repel the aggressions of France,
or to suppress the turbulence and insurrectionary
spirit of their own citizens. These
were not the mere tumultuous skirmishes
which have been dignified by the title of
<i>wars</i> amongst the rival cities and states of
northern Italy about the same period, and
in which it not unfrequently happened that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
no blood was spilt; but in the battles of
Courtrai, Rosebeke and Everghem, the citizens
could send 20 to 40,000 soldiers into
the field, and conducted their hostilities
almost upon the scale of modern warfare.
At Courtrai, “the men of Ghent” carried
off seven hundred golden spurs from
the defeated nobles of France. When
Charles VII was preparing to expel the
English from Calais, Philip the Good was
able to send him 40,000 men as a subsidy,
of whom 16,000 were from Ghent alone.</p>

<p>Nor were these <i>internal</i> feuds upon a
minor scale. Jacques van Artevelde, the
Masaniello of Flanders, and more generally
known as “<i>the Brewer of Ghent</i>,” from
his having joined the guild of that trade,
from which he was afterwards chosen by
fifty other corporations of tradesmen, as
the head of each, was enabled to organize
such an army of the city companies, as to
render his alliance an object of importance
to Edward III of England, when making
his preparations for invading France.</p>

<p>Under this extraordinary “tribune of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the people,” Ghent was enabled, virtually,
to cast off its allegiance to the courts of
Flanders, to elect Artevelde as their Ruwaert
or Protector, and to bid defiance to
their native sovereign, backed by all the
power of France. Artevelde became the
personal friend and counsellor of the English
King, who sent ambassadors to his
court, and entered into alliance with the
city he commanded in conjunction with
that of Bruges and Ypres. It was at the
suggestion of Artevelde, that Edward quartered
the arms of France and assumed the
fleur de lis, which for so many centuries
was borne upon the shield of England; and
it was in the palace of the Flemish demagogue,
that Queen Philippa gave birth to a
son, whose name has made Ghent familiar
in the annals of England:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“Old John of <i>Gaunt</i>, time honoured Lancaster.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Ruwaert in honour of Philippa gave
her name to his son, who, at a subsequent
period, became the demagogue of Ghent,
and who,</p>

</p>

<p>But the fate, like the fortune of Artevelde,
was characteristic of the proverbial
caprice and vacillations of republican popularity.
After being for ten years or more,
the idol of the people, he presumed to induce
them to expel the Counts of Flanders
from the succession, and to acknowledge
the Black Prince, the son of his friend, as
their sovereign in his stead; but his followers,
startled at so bold a proposition,
made a pretence for getting rid of their
“protector,” and massacred Artevelde in
his own house, which they burned to the
ground, “Poor men raised him,” says
Froissart, “and wicked men slew him.”</p>

<p>Thirty years after, when Flanders, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the marriage of Margaret with Philip the
Hardy, Duke of Burgundy, became united
with that sovereignty, and the citizens were
again at war amongst themselves, “the
men of Ghent” elected Philip van Artevelde,
godson of Queen Philippa, and her
namesake, the son of their former favourite
and victim, as their leader in their strifes
with the burghers of Bruges, who were
about to cut a canal from their city to
Denys, which would have been injurious to
the prosperity of Ghent, which had “the
harvest of the river for her revenue,” when
Philip defeated the army of Louis le Mael,
entered Bruges in triumph, and carried off
the Golden Dragon as large as an ox, which,
till lately, surmounted the belfry of Ghent,
and is said to have been brought home by
the Flemings who followed Count Baldwin to
Constantinople.</p>

<p>But the power of France leagued with
his native sovereign was irresistible, and
at the battle of Rosebeke, he laid down, at
once, his usurped authority and his life.</p>

<p>Under the Dukes of Burgundy, the annals
of these remarkable military merchants
is the same continued story of broils and
battles, and the union of Flanders to Austria,
by the marriage of Mary of Burgundy,
only brought a fresh line of combatants
into the Low Countries.</p>

<p>In 1500, Charles V, the grandson of this
ominous alliance, was born at Ghent, in the
old château of the Counts of Flanders, the
remains of which are still to be seen in the
Place de St. Pharailde, converted into a
cotton factory, the lofty chimney of which
now pours its volume of smoke above the
cradle of a monarch who made it his boast,
that “the sun never set upon his dominions.”</p>

<p>With the same fiery independence of
their forefathers, the “men of Ghent,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
resisted the despotism of the Emperor as
sturdily as they had done the exactions of
their Earls and Dukes; and it was after
quelling one of these insurrections, that
Charles, intent on devising a punishment
for their contumacy, was advised by the
Duke of Alva, the future Moloch of the
Netherlands under Philip II, to raze it to
its foundations, when Charles replied by
pointing to its towers and palaces, and
asking him in a repetition of his former
witticism, “combien il croyait qu’il fallait
de peaux (<i>villes</i>) d’Espagne, pour faire un
<i>gant</i> de cette grandeur.”</p>

<p>Charles, however, exacted a punishment
more humiliating, if not so savage as that
contemplated by the <i>bourreau</i> of the church,
by repealing all the charters of the city,
dismounting their famous bell, Roland,
fining the community, and compelling the
ringleaders to supplicate his mercy in
their shirts, with halters round their necks,
a ceremony which is erroneously said to
have been commemorated by the magistrates
of Ghent continuing to wear the rope,
as a part of their official costume, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
which is still kept alive in the distich which
enumerates the characteristics of the Flemish
cities:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the abdication of Charles V, that
most remarkable incident in the history of
kings, which took place in the church of
St. Gudule at Brussels, and the accession
of Philip II, arose the reign of terror in
the Netherlands, when Alva and his bloodhounds
ravaged Flanders, and their successors,
for twenty years, rendered her cities
abattoirs of Europe.</p>

<p>In these events, Ghent took a prominent
part, and the siege of her citadel, which
was garrisoned by the Spaniards, affords the
noble story of its defence till reduced by
famine, when the Flemish, on its surrender,
discovered that its heroic resistance
had been the work of a woman, Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Mondragon, the wife of the commandant,
who, in the absence of her husband, had
assumed his command, and capitulated only
when hunger and disease had reduced her
little garrison to one hundred and fifty
souls, including herself and her children.
Philip, weary of the war, and assured of
the loss of Holland, which had adopted its
liberator, the Prince of Orange, as its sovereign,
compromised in some degree with
the Flemish, by separating their country
from the crown of Spain, and conferring it
on his daughter, Isabella, by whose marriage
with Albert, it became again united
to the house of Austria, under whose dominion
it remained, with the exception of
its brief occupation by Louis XIV previous
to the treaty of Utrecht, till incorporated
with the French republic in 1794, and subsequently
annexed to Holland in February
1815.</p>

<p>The streets of Ghent are full of monuments
and reminiscences of these stormy
and singular times. In a small triangular
place, called the Toad’s-corner (Padden
hoek), stood the house of the elder Artevelde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and the scene of his murder; that which
has been erected upon the spot, bears an
inscription on its front:—“<span class="allsmcap">ICI PERIT VICTIME
D’UNE FACTION, LE XXVII JUILLET
MCCCXXXXV, JACQUES VON ARTAVELDE QUI
ELEVA LES COMMUNES DE FLANDRE A UNE
HAUTE PROSPERITÉ.</span>”</p>

<p>In the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>, one of the enormous
edifices of the period, in Moresco
gothic architecture, the celebrated declaration,
called “the Pacification of Ghent,”
by which the states of the Netherlands
formed their federation to resist the tyrannous
bigotry of Philip II, was signed by
the representatives of Holland and Belgium
in 1576.</p>

<p>Close by it stands the belfry from which
Charles V directed the removal of the pride
of the burghers, their ponderous bell <i>Roland</i>,
which, by turns, sounded the tocsin
of revolt, or chimed in the carillon of loyalty;
the tradition says it was of such dimensions
as to weigh six tons, and was
encircled by an inscription:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mynen naem is Roland—als ick clippe dan is’t brandt</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Al sick luyde, dan is’t <i>storm in Vlaenderlande</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>
<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>
<p>“<i>When I ring, there is fire; when I toll, there is a tempest in Flanders.</i>”</p>
 </blockquote>

<p class="noin">And many a stormy reveille it must have
pealed over the hive of turbulent craftsmen
who swarmed around its base.</p>

<p>Not far from the belfry, is the Friday
market (<i>Marché de Vendredi</i>), “the forum”
of ancient Ghent, where all its municipal
ceremonies were solemnized, and all its
popular assemblies were convened, to the
tolling of their favourite bell; in which,
also, the Counts of Flanders took the oath
of inauguration, on their accession to the
sovereignty. It was here that John Lyon
convened his guild of watermen, and persuaded
them to assume the old symbol of
revolt, the white hood, in order to resist
the exactions of Louis le Mael; and it was
here that John Breydel, another fiery demagogue,
marshalled his band of “lion’s
claws” in 1300, and led them to the “Battle
of the Spurs” at Courtrai; and it was
here that Jacques van Artevelde, at the
head of his “trades’ union,” was proclaimed
Ruwaert of Flanders. It was here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
that the commotions, so quaintly detailed by
Froissart, took place between the fullers
and the weavers, on Black Monday, in
1345, when the latter were expelled from
Ghent, after leaving fifteen hundred of their
number dead in the streets; and it was
here that, in later times, the ferocious
Duke of Alva lit the flames of the inquisition,
and consumed the contumacious protestants
of the Low Countries.</p>

<p>In Ghent, almost every great event in
the chronicles of the old city is, more or less,
identified with the Marché de Vendredi.
In the centre of its square, the citizens, in
1600, erected a column to the memory of
Charles V, which was levelled by the French
republicans in 1794, in order to plant the
tree of liberty on its foundation.</p>

<p>In a recess of this market-place, stands
the wonder of Ghent, “<i>la merveille de
Gand</i>,” an enormous cannon of the fourteenth
century, used by Philip van Artevelde,
at the siege of Audenarde in
1382; but how it was ever dragged 
<span class="err" title="original: to to">to</span> the field, or manœuvred in the action, is
one of the enigmas of ancient warfare, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
is upwards of eighteen feet long, ten inches
in the diameter of the bore, and weighs
thirty-nine thousand pounds. It is made of
malleable iron, and is mentioned by Froissart
as discharging balls during the siege, with
a report which “was heard at five leagues
distance by day, and ten by night,” and
sounded as if “<i>tous les diables d’enfer fussent
en chemin</i>.” It was brought from Audenarde
to Ghent, having, I presume, been
left upon the field by the discomfited Flemings.
Its popular soubriquet is “<i>Dulle
Greite</i>,” or Mad Margaret, in compliment
to a Countess of Flanders, of violent memory,
who is still known by the traditional
title of “the Black Lady,” given to her by
her subjects.</p>

<p>These and a thousand similar records
and memorials of the olden time, render a
stroll through the streets of Ghent, one of
singular interest and amusement; and, perhaps,
there is no city of Europe which more
abounds in these relics of local history, or
has preserved so many characteristics of
manners and customs in keeping with its
associations of the past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> heard so much in England of
the gigantic scale of the establishments for
the construction of machinery in Belgium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
we paid a visit this morning to the great
<i>Phœnix Iron works</i> at Ghent, the largest in
the kingdom; (indeed, I may presume, the
largest in Europe), except those of Seraing
near Liege. The surprising progress which
the Belgians have, within the last few years,
made in this department, is naturally a subject
of the deepest interest in this country.
Twenty years ago, the manufacturers of the
Netherlands were altogether dependant
upon France and England, for everything
except the most ordinary pieces of machinery,
which were used in the simplest
processes—but the refusal of Great Britain,
to permit its exportation upon any terms,
naturally left them no alternative, but
either to abandon their manufactures, or to
apply their own ingenuity to the construction
of machinery for themselves. To the
encouragement of the latter attempt, the
King of Holland, for the fifteen years that
Belgium was under his protection, applied
himself with an energy and zeal, that is
positively without parallel; patronage, personal
exertions, and pecuniary assistance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
were devoted to the promotion of this important
object, with an assiduity and perseverance
almost incredible; his efforts
were crowned with perfect success, and
even his enemies, are forced to admit that
the singular developement which has taken
place in the resources of Belgium, in this
important department, are all to be ascribed
to the untiring energy and exertions of the
King of Holland.</p>

<p>His efforts were much facilitated by the
relaxation, in the meantime, of the policy
of England, so far as to permit the free
exportation of certain machinery, and what
was of infinitely greater importance, <i>of the
most complex and ingenious tools</i> for its construction.
The effects of the latter measure,
in particular, and the impetus which
it has communicated to the manufacture
of machinery, not only in Belgium, but in
every other country of Europe which aspires
to it, is positively beyond calculation. It
gave, at once, to our continental rivals the
very arcana of our superiority; tools that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
themselves the most beautiful and elaborate
machines, performing like automatons operations
that once required all the intelligence
as well as all the dexterity of an
artisan; lathes and planes that grapple
with a beam of iron as if it were green
wood, and shape and polish the most ponderous
shafts with as much ease as a turner
produces an ivory toy.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Placing these unreservedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
in the hands of the engineers of 
the continent, and, at the same time, refusing
to let them have the articles which they
were almost spontaneously to produce, was
neither more nor less than peremptorily
withholding the fruit, but making no compliment
whatever of sending the tree.</p>

<p>The refusal of Great Britain to concede
the whole question has, at all times, excited
an intense feeling on the continent, and
the Belgians themselves are amongst the
loudest in denouncing this “jealous and
narrow-minded policy of England;” forgetful
that they themselves in 1814 adopted
identically the same course, and prohibited
under pain of fine and imprisonment the
exit of their own machinery or artisans, such
as they were! Even now, the value of that
which England conceded, is forgotten in the
importance attached to that which she still
withholds, and even the appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
mystery connected with the prohibition
increases its importance in imagination and
whets the appetite to obtain it. A whimsical
illustration of their ideas upon the
subject occurs in the work of M. Briavionne,
who gravely asserts that “the manufacturers
of Lancashire, impatient to participate in
the cares of the government upon this point,
have submitted to a voluntary tax sufficient
to organize a perpetual guard, which surrounds
Manchester night and day to prevent
the exit of machinery.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>However, it is notorious that notwithstanding
these sleepless precautions and in
spite of every prohibition, machinery of
every description is at the present moment
smuggled into Belgium, and every other
state that requires it—not, perhaps, in such
quantities as to serve for the fitting up of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
extensive factories, but so as to afford a
model of every improvement and every
new invention for the instant adoption,
and imitation of the continental engineers
and mechanicians. Thus provided and
thus encouraged, speculating upon capital
supplied lavishly by their government,
equipped with the most valuable English
tools, inspected by English artisans, and
working from English models, the Belgians
have now far outstripped all the rest of Europe
in the manufacture of machines of every
description, and in all but the cost of construction,
and that beauty of finish which
matured skill can alone achieve, they at
present bid fair to rival England herself in
her peculiar and hitherto undisputed domain.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Phœnix, is one
of those which have sprung up, thus stimulated
and thus encouraged. It was originally
erected by an individual proprietor,
M. Huytens Kerremans, in 1821, and attained
much of its reputation under the
management of an Englishman, named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Bell, so much so, that at the period of the
revolution in 1830, it employed upwards
of two hundred and twenty workmen daily.
In 1836, on the death of the proprietor, it
passed into the hands of a joint stock company,
by whom it has been enlarged to
more than thrice its previous extent, at an
expense of upwards of one million of francs.
It is at present conducted by Mr. Windsor,
a gentleman from Leeds, and is certainly
the most admirably arranged establishment
of the kind I have ever seen—those of
England not excepted.</p>

<p>It at present employs seven hundred
hands, of whom two hundred are apprentices,
and of the remainder, between fifty
and sixty English. The range of its productions
includes every species of machine
used for spinning flax, cotton, silk, or wool,
as well as for other manufactures in which
machinery is required, for which there is
a brisk demand at present, not only in
Belgium, but for Spain, Austria, France
and Holland. In point of finish and beauty,
the spinning machinery is certainly, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
have said, inferior to the English, it is
also stated to be defective in other respects,
but those proprietors of mills who
are using it, made no complaints to me
upon the subject, and seemed perfectly
satisfied with its execution. Some of the
heavier articles in process of construction,
especially a spiral roving-frame which some
English workmen were completing, seemed,
in every respect both of finish and action,
to be quite equal to those made at Manchester
and Leeds.</p>

<p>The establishment contains a preparatory
workshop on a comprehensive scale,
fitted up with small tools and machinery,
and superintended by two competent directors,
solely for the instruction of apprentices,
and its success we were told had
been most gratifying. The Englishmen
employed at the Phœnix receive higher
wages than the Flemings, but the majority
of them are only retained till their original
engagements shall have been completed,
when their services will be dispensed with,
and their places supplied by native workmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
at wages not exceeding twenty francs 
per week, and fully competent to undertake
their duties.</p>

<p>One important feature in this immense
manufactory is, that it is gradually succeeding
in making its own tools, instead of
importing them as heretofore from England.
The majority of those in use had been already
constructed upon the spot upon
English models, and at the moment we
called, a planing machine, twenty feet long,
was in process of erection, together with
drills, sliding lathes, dividing and filing apparatus,
and in short, every description of
tool in use in Great Britain. In this respect,
the directors assured me of their
confidence of being, for the future, perfectly
independent of any supply from abroad—but
I should add, that afterwards at the rival establishment
at Seraing, where all the tools
are imported from England, I was told that
those made at the Phœnix were not only
much more expensive, but of inferior
quality.</p>

<p>The works were in full employment at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the period of our visit, from the fact of there
being three flax spinning mills in course of
construction in Ghent; but it remains to
be seen whether its present vigorous prosperity
is the result of a permanent cause,
and whether the career of Belgian manufactures,
and the demand created in consequence,
will be such as to maintain in
remunerative operation this splendid establishment,
as well as that of Seraing and
the minor works of the same kind at Brussels,
Verviers, Namur, Charleroi and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the Phœnix, we
passed the great basin of the Sas de Gand
Canal, which by connecting Ghent with
Terneuse at the mouth of the Scheldt, has
effectually rendered it a sea-port in the heart
of Belgium. This bold idea was originally
conceived by Napoleon, but carried into
effect, and the basin completed, by the
King of Holland only two years before he
was driven from the country by the revolution.
As the embouchure of the canal,
however, is situated in Zeeland, a province<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
of the Dutch dominions, its navigation was
effectually closed from 1830 to 1839, when
the treaty was ratified, which finally determined
the limits of the two States. During
those nine years, the magnificent dock at
Ghent, and the line of the canal itself, were
stagnant, and the passage rapidly filling up
with sand and silt, another of the many
inconveniences entailed upon the merchants
of Belgium by “the repeal of the union.”
It is at last, however, opened to the trade,
and when we saw it, contained a number of
vessels, some discharging cotton, and one
taking in cargo for the Havanna. During
the few months that had elapsed from its
opening in October, 1839, upwards of one
hundred and twenty vessels had entered and
departed by it from Ghent, for Holland,
and the Hanse Towns, London, the Mediterranean,
and the United States.</p>

<p>On our return we drove to the <i>Beguinage</i>,
a little enclosed district, appropriated as
the residence of an ancient community of
nuns, who take no vow, but on contributing
to the general funds of the community, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
admitted into the sisterhood, and devote
their lives to works of charity and benevolence,
especially to attendance on the sick
and poor. They are each clad in the costume
of the order. For a head-dress, they carry the
<i>beguine</i>, a veil of white muslin, folded square,
and laid flat upon the top of the head,
whence they derive their name, with a black
silk hood, termed a <i>faille</i>, said to have been
anciently worn by the ladies of Flanders,
and closely resembling, both in name and
appearance, the <i>faldetta</i> of the Maltese.
This interesting society contains between
seven and eight hundred members, and
occupies not a detached building, as elsewhere,
but a little retired section of the
city, surrounded by a fosse, and enclosed
by a wall, at the gate of which, one of the
sisterhood acts as porter. The whole is
divided into streets, consisting of rows of
quaint looking little houses, of venerable
brick-work, with Dutch gables and cut stone
windows, each door inscribed with the
name of a particular saint, Agatha,
Catherine, or Theresa, instead of that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
its occupant. In the centre is a spacious
square, with an old Spanish looking church,
rather richly ornamented, and containing a
few curious paintings and carvings in oak.
The order is of very high antiquity, dating
some twelve hundred years ago, and the
present establishment was founded in the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>When the convents of the Low Countries
were reduced in number by the Austrian
government under Joseph II, he made a
special exemption in favour of the Beguines,
they were equally recognized and protected,
when the French directory completed the
suppression of the remaining religious
houses of Belgium, and the King of
Holland following the same example, confirmed
them, in the possession of their privileges
and property, by a charter granted in
1826 or 1827. A number of the sisters
occupy a portion of their time in making
lace; their dwellings, streets and gardens,
are preserved with a “beauty of cleanliness”
truly delightful. Every thing we could
see or learn of their inmates was characterized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
by gentleness and goodness, and 
their active benevolence, (in spite of my
uncle Toby’s insinuation,) the dictate of
their heart, and not of their profession.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
In the whole aspect of their dwelling, there
was nothing of the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Relentless walls, whose darksome round contains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repentant sighs and voluntary pains.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">But a cheerful serenity, and an enlivening
interest, very different from the ideas
usually associated with the gloom of a convent.</p>

<p>The churches of Ghent in which, as
usual, the grand objects of curiosity and
vertu are amassed and exhibited, are in point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
of number, richness, and sombre beauty, quite
proportionate to the other attractions of
Ghent. They are all, (with one exception,
that of St. Peter’s, which is a copy of the one
at Rome,) built in the same venerable and
massive style of gothic architecture, with
huge square turrets, lofty aisles, rich altars,
pulpits of carved oak and marble, and
chapels decorated with paintings by
the old masters of the Flemish School.
The population is almost exclusively
Roman Catholic, hardly 2000 of its 95,000
inhabitants being of the reformed religion.
For the use of the latter, a church was appropriated
by the King of Holland, in
1817, which had once been attached to a
convent of Capuchins, and on their suppression,
had been converted into a military
magazine and hospital by the French.
Such, however, was the animosity of the
priesthood to this act of toleration on the
part of the King, that it was for some time
necessary to station a guard, both within
the church and without, to protect those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
who frequented it from violence or insult.
And yet Ghent has the reputation of being
the least intolerant and bigoted city in
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The cathedral of St. Bavon, besides being
the oldest, is by far the most magnificent
in Ghent, and seems, in fact, to have a high
reputation for its splendour, as we repeatedly
heard of it at subsequent points of
our tour. The whole of the basement is
occupied by one vast crypt or <i>souterrain</i>,
the low vaulted arches of which, rest on
the shafts of the huge columns which
support the roof of the grand edifice
above. Like it, it is divided into a series
of little gloomy chapels, containing the
tombs of some of the ancient families of distinction,
and occasionally decorated by pictures
and statues of extreme antiquity.
The brothers John and Hubert Van Eyck,
the painters and their sister, who was likewise
an artist, sleep in one grave under the
floor of this melancholy vault. Over the
grand entrance to the cathedral is a curious
old statue of St. Bavon holding a hawk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
upon his wrist, a curious attitude, though
characteristic of the manners of the times.
The coup-d’œil of the interior is surprisingly
grand, the choir being separated from
the nave and aisles by lofty columns of
variegated marbles, and the entrance to each
of the four and twenty chapels which surround
the church, covered by a screen of neat
design, sometimes in carved oak or stone,
but more frequently in gilded brass or
iron of exquisite workmanship.</p>

<p>The numerous paintings with which the
church is covered are few of them of extraordinary
merit, they are chiefly by the
artists, contemporary and subsequent to
Rubens, Crayer, Otto Vennius, Honthorst,
Serghers and others. The most remarkable
painting is that of the Saint Agneau or
adoration of the lamb by the Van Eycks.
It is in marvellous preservation, and is one
of the most valuable specimens remaining
of the school to which it belongs. It contains
a profusion of figures, finished with
the richness and delicacy of a miniature,
and represents the lamb upon an altar, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the midst of a rich landscape, surrounded
by angels, and worshipped by multitudes of
popes, emperors, monks and nuns. It is
surmounted and surrounded by a number
of compartments, containing pictures of
the Saviour and the Virgin, and representing
divers incidents in the life of the former;
in addition to these, there were originally
six doors or <i>volets</i> to the picture, which, by
some ignorance of the persons in charge of
them, were actually sold in 1816 for a
mere trifle to an Englishman called Solly,
from whom they were bought by the King
of Prussia, for 400,000 francs, and they now
decorate the museum at Berlin. There is
also a picture by Rubens, of St. Bavon
retiring to a monastery, after having distributed
his goods to the poor, which was
carried by Napoleon to Paris, and restored
in 1819.</p>

<p>The choir, which is finished with
carved mahogany, has on either side, at the
entrance, two statues of St. Peter and St.
Paul casting the viper from his hand, by
Van Poucke, a modern Flemish sculptor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
who died at Rome in 1809. Among its
other ornaments are four lofty candelabra
of polished copper, once the property of
Charles I of England, and sold along with
the other decorations of the chapel at
Whitehall by order of the Commonwealth.
Round the altar are also some tombs of the
former prelates of Ghent, amongst which,
that by Duquesnoy of the Bishop Triest,
is regarded as the finest piece of sculpture
in the Netherlands. The mitred dignitaries
each repose upon his sculptured
sarcophagus, or kneel with clasped and
upraised hands:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Seeming to say the prayer when dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That living they had never said.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here, again, the pulpit is an extraordinary
production in carved wood of huge
dimensions, but with white marble ornaments
and figures injudiciously intermingled
with the rich old oak. The principal
figures are statues of Truth awakening
Time, and presenting to him the scriptures
with the motto, “<i>surge qui dormis illuminabit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
te Christus!</i>” This pulpit, which is 
far inferior to those at Antwerp and elsewhere,
is not by Verbruggen, who is the
Canova of wood, but by an artist of Ghent,
called Laurence Delvaux, who died about
1780.</p>

<p>The other churches present a succession
of objects which is almost as tiresome to
visit as it is tedious to enumerate. That
of St. Michael, in extent and magnificence,
is second only to the cathedral.
Amongst a host of ordinary
paintings, and some by modern artists,
especially one of great merit, by Paelinck,
a native of Ghent, it possesses a chef
d’œuvre of Vandyk, a “Crucifixion,” in
which he has introduced the same magnificent
horse as in his picture of Charles V, in
the Sal di Baroccio, at Florence. Sir Joshua
Reynolds calls it “one of his noblest
works.” It had been injured by repeated
cleanings, but M. Voisin, the historian of
Ghent, observes with much naïveté, “qu’il
vient d’être restauré par un artiste habile.”
Who he may be who has ventured to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
restore a chef-d’œuvre of Vandyck, M.
Voisin discreetly forbears to name.</p>

<p>An association, called the Brotherhood
of St. Ivoy, formerly met in this church,
which was composed of the most distinguished
members of the bar, who gave
advice to the poor, and bore the expense
of any legal process which it might be necessary
to institute for them out of a
common fund. This law hospital has not,
however, survived the revolution of 1830.
The music and choir of St. Michael’s are
remarkably fine, the organ is of extraordinary
richness and volume, and nothing
could possibly be more sublime than its
melodious tones resounding amidst the
“dim religious light” of the old gothic
church, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the church of St. Sauveur, Rue des
Prêtres, there is a painting of the “Descent
from the Cross,” by Van Hanslaere, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of the most distinguished living artists of
Belgium, and in that of St. Peter, a copy
by Van Thulden, from Rubens’ picture of
the Triumph of Truth over Luther and
Calvin, who are represented in the agonies
of annihilation, trampled underfoot by the
rampant followers of Truth, who are pursuing
their disciples in all directions. In
the foreground, a lion is introduced allegorically,
pawing a wolf whom he has just
strangled, emblematic, no doubt, of the
fall of heresy under the hands of the church.</p>

<p>We drove to the village of Gavre, about
ten miles from Ghent, to dine at the villa
of M. Grenier, a very splendid house recently
erected upon one of the very few
elevated points, for it cannot be called a
hill, which are to be found in Flanders,
and which, from the vast level plain over
which it rises, commands a most enchanting
view; the ancient town of Audenarde
lying <span class="err" title="original: immediatetely">immediately</span> in front, and the “lazy
Scheldt” winding its devious way amidst
innumerable hamlets, woods and villages
as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<p>It was at Gavre, that the Duke of Marlborough
encamped on his triumphal march
from Ramillies, where, after taking all the
intervening cities and strong-holds of Flanders,
together with Audenarde and Ghent,
almost in the space of a week, he addresses
thence to the Duchess the remarkable letter,
in which he says, “so many towns have
submitted since the battle, that it really
looks more like a dream than truth,” and
in another place, he says, “I am so persuaded
that this campaign will give us a
good peace, that I beg of you to do all you
can that our house at Woodstock may be
carried up as much as possible, that I may
have a prospect of living in it.”</p>

<p>It was the fête of some saint in the villages
through which we drove, and every
country inn seemed full of enjoyment; tents
filled with dancers, and parties engaged in
athletic games before the doors. In one
place a considerable crowd were assembled
round the maypole to shoot with the bow
at the popinjay. This is a favourite exercise
of the Flemings, who are exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
expert in it, the company which we passed,
was composed indifferently of the gentry
and peasants, who seemed to enter into
it with equal spirit. At Ghent, there is an
association for the purpose of practising
the use of the bow, called the Confrères de
Saint George, a relic of the time when
every district of Flanders had a similar
society, all which used to meet at Ghent
to contend for the prize, and the successful
town caused a mass to be celebrated in honour
of the victor, and gave to the poor
the scarlet cloaks, laced with gold, which
had been worn as the costume of the day.</p>

<p>The roads through this part of Belgium
are made like those of France, with a raised
pavé in the centre only, a custom enforced,
in a great part, by the great expense
of bringing stones from a distance for their
construction, scarcely any being to be
found in Flanders or the west. The bye-roads
being all across sand, unconsolidated
in any way, are all but impassable.</p>

<p>The Belgian hour for dinner is equally
early with that of the tables-d’hôte, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
from two to three or four o’clock, and as there
is no prolonged sitting for wine afterwards,
the entertainment ends before we in England
think of dressing for dinner. The cuisine
at M. Grenier’s was altogether French, including,
however, some dishes peculiarly
Flemish, amongst others, the large smoked
ham, which is an invariable accompaniment
at every table throughout Belgium,
and seems to be in as high estimation now,
as when Rome was supplied with them by
the ancient Menapii of the Ardennes; it
comes to table decorated by a chased silver
handle screwed on to the shank bone, to
avoid using the fork in carving it. Another
national dish was the <i>hareng frais</i>,
herring pickled like anchovies, and used
like them without further cooking: it is,
however, equally common in Holland, where
the fishery is of high importance—in Belgium
it is rapidly declining.</p>

<p>The style of everything in M. Grenier’s
establishment, and in those of the same
rank where we had the honour to visit,
was essentially French, his family having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
been educated in Paris, and the conversation
was of course in French, although
every one at table seemed to understand
English perfectly. Flemish is spoken only
by the peasantry and the working classes.
The account given of it as a dialect was,
that “Dutch is bad German, and Flemish
bad Dutch.” It is, however, by no means
inharmonious, and in point of antiquity,
I was told by Count d’Hane, that the earliest
printed comedy in Europe still exists in
Flemish. A stroll in the grounds after
dinner, and music and singing on our return
to the drawing-room concluded an
exceedingly agreeable evening, and we
returned early to Ghent.</p>

<p class="right">
10 September, 1840.
</p>

<p>We had, this morning, a visit from
Count d’Hane, a member of the “senate,”
the elective House of Peers for Belgium,
to which he is returned for the district of
Alost. The Count is a younger brother of
the most distinguished family of Ghent, and
head of the educational section of the legislature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
besides being an ardent amateur of 
agriculture. He is married to the only
daughter of M. de Potter (not the de Potter
of the Revolution, however) and in conformity
to the Flemish usage, has appended
the name of that family to his own. We
drove along with him to the house of his
mother, the Dowager Countess d’Hane de
Steenhausen, in the Rue des Champs, the
most splendid mansion in the city, built in
the style of Louis XIV, and containing a
collection of choice pictures of the Dutch
school. The dining-room is a superb
saloon with mirrored walls, an inlaid parquet
and richly painted ceiling: the latter,
however, is torn down in many places, the
soldiers of the French revolutionary army
having thrust their sabres through it in
1794, in the hope of finding gold concealed
between it and the floor above, an outrage,
the traces of which the owners have never
removed. It was in these apartments that
the late Count received the Emperor Alexander
on his return from England after the
Peace of Paris, and the same suite of rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
were subsequently the residence of Louis
XVIII, who fled hither during the Hundred
Days, and remained till the events of 1815,
restored him to his throne.</p>

<p>A few doors distant in the same street,
we visited the gallery of M. Schamps which
had long been regarded as one of the lions of
Ghent. It has since been dispersed and sold.
When we saw it, it was numbered and catalogued,
and the rooms filled with dealers
from all parts of Europe, inspecting their
intended purchases previous to the auction,
which was to take place a few days after.
The gentleman by whom it was originally
collected is but recently dead, and its dispersion
now was attributed, we were told,
partly to impatience of the present proprietor,
at having his retirement perpetually invaded
by travellers to see his pictures, and
partly by the operation of the law against
primogeniture, which rendered its sale indispensable,
in order to a more equal partition
of the family estates.</p>

<p>Count d’Hane did us the favour to conduct
us over the buildings of the University,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
one of the many valuable institutions for
which Belgium is indebted to the munificence
of the King of Holland. It was
founded by him in 1816, and thrown open
for the reception of students in 1826; an
inscription upon the portico records the
event, <i>Auspice Gulielmo I. Acad. Conditore,
posuit, S. P. Q. G.</i> <span class="allsmcap">DCCCXXVI</span>. the initials
in the usual magniloquence of the low
countries, represent the Senatus Populus
Que Gandavensis!</p>

<p>The buildings from a design of Roelandt,
an artist of Nieuport, are in a style of chaste
Corinthian architecture, the portico ornamented
with sculpture in alto relievo, the
vestibule superbly flagged in a mosaic of
colored marbles, and the hall and staircase
ornamented with busts and caryatides in
white marble. The theatres are on a magnificent
scale, richly furnished and lighted
by lofty lanterns in the vaults of the roof.
The course of education, besides most extensive
primary schools, comprises the faculties
of law, medicine and divinity, with
science and belles-lettres, and the number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
students is between 300 and 400 attending
the classes of thirty professors. There is
attached to the University a library of sixty
thousand volumes, a collection of philosophical
apparatus of great value, and museums
of antiquities, natural history, mineralogy
and comparative anatomy, and the
whole institution having been recently remodelled
and placed under the care of a
vigilant and anxious committee, it promises
to be one of the most important and beneficial
foundations in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The entire system of primary education,
however, is in anything but a satisfactory
position in Belgium. Under the regence
of Holland, the Dutch system of rational
education was imparted to Belgium. Schools
were established in every district, under the
superintendance of provincial committees,
instruction was supplied gratuitously, and
the children of the poor were required to
avail themselves of it, whilst to secure its
efficiency, no teacher was allowed to be employed
who had not undergone a thorough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
examination, and been furnished with a
diploma of competency.</p>

<p>This feature of the government was from
the first vehemently opposed by the Belgian
clergy, who saw in it an encroachment upon
the right claimed by the Catholic Church to
regulate the quantity as well as the quality
of national education, and when in 1830,
they succeeded in effecting the “repeal of the
Union,” between the two countries, the entire
system was abolished at one fell swoop.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Education, like every thing else, was declared
to be free, and the new government
did away with all official supervision of
schools, and the necessity for any enquiry
into the competency of teachers. The
result of this has been, that although the
number of schools has not been diminished,
the nature of the instruction and the qualification
of the teacher, is of so very low a
description, as to be thus characterised in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
a modern work upon the subject, by M.
Ducpétiaux,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> himself, a distinguished Belgian,
and intimately acquainted with the
subject.</p>

<p>“Instruction in our schools is generally
faulty and incomplete, and little merits the
praise which has been bestowed upon it.
<i>The best thing that can be said in its favour is,
that it is better than no instruction at all</i>, and
that it is more satisfactory to see children
sitting on the benches of a school, even
although they be doing nothing to the purpose,
than to behold them working mischief
on the streets. They are taught to read,
write, and figure a little; <i>to teach them less
is scarcely possible</i>. We speak here of primary
schools in general, and affirm that
those who attribute a moralising influence
to the majority of these schools, deceive
themselves in a manner the most strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and prejudicial to the interest of the class
whose children are the pupils in these seminaries.
A degree of instruction so limited,
so meagre, is nearly equivalent to
none whatever; and it is impossible that
things should be in a better case, seeing
that the education of the <i>teachers</i> themselves
is of the most imperfect kind. Barely
do these persons know the little which
they undertake to impart, and they have,
generally speaking, the most superficial
notions of those methods of instilling knowledge,
which they impudently attempt to
apply in the case of those only a little more
ignorant than themselves.”</p>

<p>The experiment of education on both
systems has now had an ample trial in
Belgium; first in fifteen years of government
protection, and now in ten years of
“free trade.” The result has been a convincing
failure, and those most clamorous
for the latter system in 1830, are now
the most urgent in their demands to revert
to the former. The provincial deputations,
in their reports, recommend the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
course, and the legislature have so far
subscribed to their views, as to propose a
projet de loi for carrying them into effect,
by restoring a modification of the system,
as before the revolution.</p>

<p>This being the market day for linen, we
went early to the Marché de Vendredi
where it is held. The winter, however, is
the season in which the market is seen to the
greatest advantage, as the farmers are not
then prevented by their agricultural employments
from attending to the weaving, and
bringing of it to town for sale in December
and January; so many as 2000 pieces
have been sold in the course of a morning.
The appearance of the peasantry was particularly
prepossessing, their features handsome,
their dress and person neat in the
extreme; the women generally wearing long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
cloaks, made of printed calico, and the
men the blouse of blue linen, which has
become almost the national costume of
Belgium.</p>

<p>The sellers of linen were arranged in long
lines, each with his webs before him resting
on a low bench, whilst the police were
present to preserve order, and see that
every individual kept his allotted place.
The webs had all previously been examined
by a public officer, who affixed his seal to
each, not as any mark of its quality or
guide to its price, but merely to testify that
it was not fraudulently made up—that it
was of the same quality throughout as on
the outer, fold, and that the quantity was
exactly what it professed to be; any fraud
attempted, in any particular, exposing the
offender to the seizure and forfeiture of the
web.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The other articles for sale in the market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
were vegetables and fruit of the ordinary
kinds, (with a profusion of Mirabelle plums,
the trees of which we saw, repeatedly,
planted in hedge-rows), woollen cloth, cutlery,
household furniture, and pottery of a
very rude description, together with numerous
stalls of books. The latter were chiefly
religious, but amongst the others were a
number of the old popular histories, which
seem to be equally favourites in England
and Flanders, such as “<i>Reynaert den Vos</i>;”—“<i>de
schoone historie van Fortunatus borsen</i>;”—“<i>de
schoone historie van den edelen Jan van
Parys</i>;”—“<i>de Twee gebroders en vroome riddens
Valentyn en Oursen den Wilden men</i>;”—“<i>Recretiven
Droomboek</i>.” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>After breakfast we went by the railroad
to Courtrai, a distance which the train accomplishes
in a little more than two hours.
My object, in the excursion, was to see the
process, which is peculiar to this district,
of steeping flax in the running waters of the
Lys. This river, which rises in the Pays
de Calais, and forms one of the boundaries
between France and Belgium, derives its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
name, in all probability, from the quantity
of water-lilies which flourish in its sluggish
current, and which are said to be the origin
of the fleur-de-lys in the royal arms of
France. The road passes through Denys,
Waereghem and Haerlebeke, three towns
which are the chief in Communes of the
same name, and are all bustling little places,
combining with agricultural industry, a considerable
trade in linen which is the great
staple of the district. At Denys, there are
also extensive distilleries of Geneva which
enjoys a considerable reputation in Belgium,
where the spirit produced by distillation is
invariably bad, except in the provinces of
Limbourg and Luxembourg, where it approaches
somewhat to the character of the
Dutch. This remarkable difference between
the produce of two countries, so
similar in almost all their resources for the
manufacture, is, perhaps, to be found in
the almost total absence of any duty of excise
upon distillation, which it was found
essential to reduce to a mere nominal sum
since 1830, in order to protect the agriculture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
of Belgium, and which, consequently, 
brought the trade into the hands of the very
lowest class, both of distillers and consumers.</p>

<p>The entire surface of the country, between
Ghent and Courtrai, is one unbroken
plain, which, though less rich and luxuriant
than the alluvial soils of Holland and of
England, exhibits, in all directions, the most
astonishing evidence of that superiority in
agricultural science for which the Flemings
are renowned over Europe. The natural
reluctance of their thin and sandy soil has
been overcome by dint of the most untiring
labour—an attention to manuring, which
approaches to the ludicrous in its details,
and, above all, by a system of rotation, the
most profoundly calculated and the most
eminently successful.</p>

<p>The general aspect of a Flemish farm;
the absence of hedge-rows, or, where they
are to be found, their elaborate training and
inter-texture, so as to present merely a
narrow vegetating surface of some two or
three feet high, and twice as many inches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
thickness; the minute division of their
fields into squares, all bearing different
crops, but performing the same circle of
rotation, and the total disappearance of all
weeds or plants, other than those sought to
be raised; all these show the practical and
laborious experience, by which they have
reduced their science to its present system,
and the indomitable industry by which,
almost inch by inch, these vast and arid
plains have been converted from blowing
sands into blooming gardens. Here draining
and irrigation are each seen in their
highest perfection, owing to the frequent
intersection of canals; whilst the same circumstance,
affording the best facilities for
the transport of manure, has been one of
the most active promoters of farming improvement.
Chaptal relates, that having
traversed one of the sandy plains of Flanders
in company with Napoleon, the Emperor,
on his return to Paris, adverted to the circumstance
of its gloomy barrenness with
an expression of surprise as well as regret,
when the practical philosopher suggested,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that the construction of a canal across it
would, within five years, convert the unproductive
waste into luxuriant farms. The
experiment was tried, and proved triumphantly
successful. The canal was opened,
and in less than the time predicted, the
results anticipated were more than realized
in its effects.</p>

<p>To fix the flying sands of Belgium, the
main and permanent expedient has been
the application of manures; the preparation
and care of this important ingredient
has been, in Flanders, reduced to an
actual trade, and barges innumerable are
in constant transit on the canals, conveying
it from its depôts and manufactories in the
villages and towns to the rural districts,
where it is to be applied. Servants, as a
perquisite, are allowed a price for all the
materials serviceable for preparing it, which
they can collect in the house and farm-yards,
and the value of which often amounts to as
much as their nominal wages. Pits and
a tank, called a <i>smoor-hoop</i>, or smothering
heap, are attached to every farm, and tended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
with a systematic care that bespeaks the
importance of their contents. Into these,
every fermentable fluid is discharged, and
mixed with the refuse of vegetables; the
rape-cake, which remains after expressing
the oil, wood-ashes, soaper’s waste, grains
from distilleries, weeds from the drains, and,
in short, every other convertible article collected
in the establishment; and often, in
addition, plants such as broom are sown in
the lands, expressly for the purpose of being
ploughed in when green to increase their
fertility, or to be cut for fermentation in the
<i>smoor-hoop</i>. This latter is constructed
with bricks, like a tan-pit, and covered with
cement to avoid escape or filtration; and
its contents, at the larger establishments,
are sold to the farmers at from three to five
francs a hogshead, in proportion to the
quality.</p>

<p>The circle of rotation is observed with
equal precision and scientific skill, and generally
consists of four or five crops and a
clean fallow, but varies, of course, according
to the nature of the soil and the articles in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
demand. The season was too advanced for
us to see the majority of the crops upon the
ground, the grain being mostly housed; but
those which were still in the field were of
the most luxuriant quality. Pasturage, there
was comparatively little; but clover, the
chef-d’œuvre of Flemish husbandry, whence
it was introduced into England, we saw in
high perfection. Some plants which are
not usual in Great Britain were to be seen in
great abundance; large fields of tobacco,
hemp, colza or rape-seed, which is largely
sown for crushing, buck-wheat or <i>sarrasin</i>,
(probably another importation of the Crusaders)
from which they make a rich and
nutritious bread. Beans and feeding crops,
especially carrots, which the sandy lands produce
luxuriantly, and turnips, appeared to
be favourites especially near the villages.</p>

<p>But the important article, and that which
I was most desirous to see, was the <i>flax</i>,
which, however, had been almost all pulled
before my visit, so that I could only see the
<i>rouissage</i> or process of watering—which,
in the district around Courtrai, is performed
in a manner almost peculiar to themselves;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
indeed, I may say altogether so, so far
as success is concerned; for although the
same practice prevails in the Department
du Nord, in France, in the vicinity
of St. Amand and Valenciennes, it is
with a much less satisfactory result: and
in Russia, where it is practised to some extent,
the flax produced is, in every way, of
inferior quality. It seems, in fact, to be a
question whether, in addition to the slow
and deep current of the Lys, and its remarkable
freedom from all impurity, it be
not possessed of some peculiar chemical
qualities, which account for its efficiency
for this purpose, whilst identically the same
process utterly fails in other streams with
no perceptible difference in the quality of
their waters.</p>

<p>It is impossible to over estimate the importance
to Great Britain of such an immediate
improvement in the process of
flax cultivation at home, as will place her
on an equality with her rivals abroad. At
present, it is an incontrovertible and uneasy
fact, that with her trade in yarn and linen
hourly encreasing, she is in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
proportion becoming more and more dependant
upon foreign countries for the
supply of the raw material. The cultivation
of flax in England, is, in all probability,
diminishing in amount, whilst year after
year, our imports from Holland, Belgium
and Prussia, are rising in a remarkable
manner. Only look to the following facts.
The great increase in our manufacture of
linen yarn, both in England, Scotland and
Ireland has taken place, since the year
1820; we then imported largely from the
continent, and spun only for our own
weavers at home, we have since then ceased
to import yarn spun by machinery altogether,
except a very small portion of the very
finest for cambrics; and actually export to
France, and elsewhere, to the value of
£746,000 per annum. Our exports of British
and Irish linen have increased in the
mean time, from 36,522,333 yards in 1820,
to 60,954,697 in 1833, and 77,195,894
yards in 1838, and what has been the
case as regards the importation of flax? The
import duty upon foreign flax, both dressed
and undressed, was at the commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of this period, £10. 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per cwt.; as
our manufacture increased, and our home
supply fell short, that duty was, in 1825,
reduced to <i>four pence</i>; when the import increased
from 376,170 cwt. to 1,018,837 cwt.
In the year following, the necessity still becoming
more pressing, and no relief arising
from home, it was further reduced to <i>three
pence</i>; the year following to <i>two pence</i>, and
in 1828 to <i>one penny</i>. The importation, all
this time, has been going on steadily increasing,
showing an average on the five
years, from 1830 to 1835, of 751,331 cwt.,
and amounting, by the last printed returns
of the House of Commons, for 1838, to
1,626,276 cwt.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It is manifest, that a trade
so valuable to us as our linen manufacture,
can never be said to be safe, so long as we
are thus dependant for the very means of
its support upon those whose manifest
advantage it is to destroy it.</p>

<p>In order to remedy this evil, it seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
me, to require only a vigorous exertion on
behalf of our own farmers, and those whose
direct interest it is to give them encouragement
to lead to such an improvement in
our process of cultivation and dressing, as
would speedily render our flax of equal
quality with that of our rivals in the Low
Countries; we may thus safely rely on its
augmented value in the market, to ensure
its production in sufficient quantity to
meet our demands, and relieve us altogether
from a dependance upon foreigners.
For the landed proprietor and the farmer,
not less than the manufacturer, there is a
mine of unwrought wealth to be secured in
this important article, and my earnestness
upon this point arises from the fact that
from all I have seen myself, or can possibly
learn from others, the field is equally open
to England as to the Netherlands—she
obtains the seed from the same quarter,
her soil and her climate are equally suitable;
the plant up to a certain stage, is as
healthy and promising with us, as with
them, but there the parallel ceases, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
all the subsequent processes, the superior
system of the Belgian gives him a golden
advantage over us. Still notwithstanding
all our disadvantages, Irish flax, for the
strong articles, to which alone it is suited,
produces a firmer, and in every respect, a
better thread than Flemish or Dutch of
the same character.</p>

<p>One source of superiority which the
farmer of Holland and the Netherlands
enjoys, is derived from the fact of his
<i>saving the seed</i> of his own flax. In the first
instance, he imports, as we do from Riga,
seed which yields a strong and robust plant,
during the first year; its produce is then preserved
and sown a second time, when it
becomes more delicate in its texture, and
the seed then obtained, is <i>never parted with</i>
by the farmer, but produces the finest and
most valuable plant. As this, however, in
time deteriorates, it is necessary to keep up
a constant succession by annual importation
of northern seed, which in turn become
acclimated, refined, and are superseded
by the next in rotation. The sagacious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Hollander thus obtains for himself a seed
for his own peculiar uses, of twice the value
of any which he exports; an advantage of
which England cannot expect to avail herself,
till the process of saving the flax-seed
for herself, becomes more generally introduced,
instead of annually importing upwards
of 3,300,000 bushels, as we do at present.</p>

<p>In Flanders, where the cultivation is so
all important, the <i>rotation</i> of all other
crops, is regulated with ultimate reference
to the flax, which comes into the circle
only once in seven years, and in some
instances, once in nine, whilst, as it approaches
the period for saving it, each
antecedent crop is put in with a double
portion of manure. For itself, the preparation
is most studiously and scrupulously
minute, the ground is prepared
rather like a flower-bed than a field, and
<i>spade labour</i> always preferred to the coarser
and less minute operation of the plough,
every film of a weed is carefully uprooted,
and the earth abundantly supplied, generally
with liquid manure, fermented with rape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
cake. The seed is then sown remarkably
<i>thick</i>, so that the plants may not only support
one another, but struggling upwards
to the light, may throw out few branches,
and rise into a taller and more delicate
stem. The <i>weeding</i> is done, whilst the
plant is still so tender and elastic as that
it may rise again readily after the operation,
and it is a remarkable illustration of the
studied tenderness with which the cultivation
is watched, that the women and children
who are employed to weed it, are generally
instructed to do so against the wind, in
order that the breeze may lift the stems as
soon as they have left them, instead of
allowing them to grow crooked, by lying
too long upon the ground. Again, in order
to give it a healthy support during its
growth, <i>stakes</i> are driven into the ground
at equal distances, from the top of which,
cords, or thin rods are extended, dividing
the field into minute squares, and thus preventing
the plants from being laid down
by any but a very severe wind.</p>

<p>The time of <i>pulling</i> depends upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
whether the farmer places most value
upon the seed or the fibre of the particular
field. If the former, he must wait till the
plant is thoroughly ripe, its capsules hard,
its leaves fallen, and its stem yellow; but in
this case, the stalk is woody and the fibre
coarse and hard; whereas, if the fineness of
the fibre be the first object, it is pulled
whilst the stalk is still green and tender,
and before the fruit has come to maturity.
At Courtrai and its vicinity, the flax when
severed from the ground, after being carefully
sunned and dried, is stored for twelvemonths
before it is submitted to the
process of watering. In the Pays de Waes,
however, this practice does not obtain, the
steeping taking place immediately on its
being pulled, and I find the inclination of
opinion to be in favour of the latter mode,
as the former is said to render the flax
harsh and discolored, whilst that immersed
at once is soft and silky, and of a delicate
and uniform tint.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that although the process
of <i>rouissage</i> or watering is felt to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
one of the utmost nicety and importance,
the ultimate value of the flax being mainly
dependent upon it, no uniform system prevails
throughout the various provinces of Belgium.
In Hainault and around Namur, where
an impression is held that the effluvia of the
flax, whilst undergoing the <i>rouissage</i>, is
injurious to health, it is interdicted by the
police, and it is consequently dew-riped,
simply by spreading it upon the grass, and
turning it from time to time, till the mucilaginous
matter, by which the fibre is retained
around the stem, is sufficiently
decomposed to permit of its being readily
separated from the wood. In the Pays de
Waes, the flax is steeped in still water as
in Ireland, except that in the latter country,
a small stream is contrived, if possible, to
pass in and out of the pit during the process.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The system of the Pays de Waes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
is that which has met with the most decided
approbation in Belgium; it is recommended
officially to the farmers in the
instructions published by the Société
Linière, an association instituted for the
purpose of promoting the cultivation of
flax, and its various manufactures.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
system at Courtrai, consists in immersing
the flax, after being dried and stored for
twelvemonths, in the running water of the
Lys; an operation, which in their hands, is
performed with the utmost nicety and precision,
and for which it is so renowned that
the crops for many miles, even so far as
Tournai, are sent to the Lys to undergo
the <i>rouissage</i>.</p>

<p>The flax, tied up in small bundles, is
placed perpendicularly in wooden frames
of from twelve to fifteen feet square, and
being launched into the river, straw and
clean stones are laid upon it till it sinks
just so far below the surface of the stream as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
to leave a current both above and below it,
which carries away all impurities, and keeps
the fibre clean and sweet during the period
of immersion. This continues for seven
or eight days, according to the heat of the
weather and the temperature of the water,
and so soon as the requisite change has
taken place in the plant, the frames are
hauled on shore, and the flax spread out
upon the grass to sun and dry it previously
to its being removed to undergo the further
processes. The <i>rouissage</i> at Courtrai is
usually performed in May, and again in
the months of August and September; after
which the flax merchants of Brabant and
the north send their agents amongst the
farmers, who purchase from house to
house, and, on a certain day, attend at the
chief town of the district to receive the
“deliveries,” when the qualities of the
crop and the average prices are ascertained
and promulgated for the guidance of the
trade.</p>

<p>From the flax grounds which lie close
by Courtrai, on the right bank of the Lys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
we crossed the river to the bleach-green on
the opposite side of the river, and if we
might judge from the extent of the buildings,
which were not larger than a good
barn, the process must be a very simple
one in Flanders, or the employment very
limited at Courtrai. The most important
establishments of this kind, however, are
at Antwerp, Brussels and Tournai.</p>

<p>The cloth on the grass was principally
diaper made on the spot and at Ypres
(whence it derives its name, <i>d’Ypres</i>,) but
it was coarse, and the designs ordinary and
inartificial. The manufacture of the article
in which Belgium formerly excelled so
much as to supply the imperial household
during the reign of Napoleon, was ruined by
his fall and the breaking up of the continental
system. At one time not less than
3000 workmen were employed in this
branch alone, but the separation of Belgium
from France in 1815, and the simultaneous
imposition of an almost prohibitory duty
on her damask has reduced the trade to a
mere cypher, not above three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
workmen being now employed at Courtrai,
the great seat of the manufacture.</p>

<p>Close by the bleach-green, we entered
a windmill for grinding bark, and at a short
distance from it, another of the same primitive
edifices was at full work, crushing
rape oil. I never saw such a miniature
manufactory—in one little apartment,
about ten feet square, the entire process
was carried on to the extent of a ton of
seed, yielding about thirty-six gallons of
oil per day. In one corner, the seed was
being ground between a pair of mill-stones;
in another, pounded in mortars
by heavy beams shod with iron, which
were raised and fell by the motion of the
wind; the material was then roasted in
an iron pan over a charcoal fire, till the
oil became disengaged by the heat, and
was then crushed by being inclosed in
canvas bags enveloped in leather cases,
and placed in grooves, into which huge
wooden wedges were driven by the force
of the machinery; the last drop of oil was
thus forced out by a repetition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
process, and the residue of the seed which
came forth in cakes as flat and as hard as
a stone, were laid on one side to be sold
for manure and other purposes.</p>

<p>A manufactory of <i>sabots</i> was attached to
the back mill, and sold for five-pence and
six-pence a pair for the largest size, and half
that amount for those suited to children.
Surely the introduction of these wooden
shoes would be a great accession to the
comforts of the Irish peasantry, as well as
a new branch of employment in their manufacture.
An expert Flemish workman
can finish a pair within an hour, and with
care they will last for three months. Four
pair of thick woollen socks to be worn
along with them costs eighteen-pence, so
that for four shillings, a poor man might
be dry and comfortably shod for twelve
months. In winter, especially, and in wet
weather, or when working in moist ground,
they are infinitely to be preferred, and
although the shape may be clumsy, (though
in this respect, the Flemish are superior to
the French), it is, at least, as graceful as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the half-naked foot and clouted shoe of the
Irish labourer. I doubt much, however,
whether the people, though ever so satisfied
of their advantages, would get over
their <span class="err" title="original: associaton">association</span> of “arbitrary power and
brass money” with the use of “wooden
shoes.”</p>

<p>Courtrai itself is a straggling, cheerless-looking
town, and possesses few objects of
any interest. Outside the gate is the
field on which was fought the Battle of the
Golden Spurs in 1302, and a little chapel
still marks the spot which was the centre
of the action. Its large market for flax
and linen has made its name familiar
abroad, but it has little within itself to
detain a stranger in search of the picturesque.
Its only antique buildings are the
Town Hall and the church of Notre-Dame,
the former contains two richly carved
mantel-pieces, evidently of very remote
date. The latter was built by Count Baldwin,
who was chosen Emperor at Constantinople
in the fourth Crusade, and contains,
amidst a host of worthless pictures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
a Descent from the Cross, by Vandyck.
Amongst the curiosities in the sacristy, is
a sacerdotal dress of Thomas a’Becket, of
most ample dimensions, which the saint
left behind him on returning to England after
his reconciliation with Henry II. At either
extremity of the bridge which crosses the
Lys in the centre of the town are two vast
circular towers, called the <i>Broellen Torren</i>
which were built in the fifteenth century,
and still serve as the town prisons. The
chief support of the town is still derived
from its linen weaving, which unlike the
usual practice in Belgium, is done in large
factories, at which the workmen attend as
in England. The production of linen of all
kinds at Courtrai is about 30,000 pieces
a year. There is also a considerable manufactory
of thread.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We this morning accompanied Count
d’Hane to visit the celebrated prison of
Ghent, the <i>maison de force</i>, which received
the applause of Howard himself, and has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the model for most of the improved penitentiaries
of Europe. It was erected in 1774,
under the auspices of Maria Theresa, whilst
the Spanish Netherlands were still attached
to the House of Austria, and for its present
state of completion and perfected system,
it is indebted to the care and munificence of
the late King, William I. of Holland. It,
at present, incloses upwards of 1,100 prisoners,
divided and classified into various
wards, and employed in various occupations
according to the nature of their
crimes and the term of their punishment.
Of these, two hundred were condemned to
perpetual labour, and one to solitary confinement
for life, the remainder for temporary
periods.</p>

<p>In Ghent there has not been more than
<i>three</i> capital executions since the year 1824,
and as Belgium has no colonies to which
to transport her secondary offenders, they
are condemned to imprisonment in all its
forms in proportion to the atrocity of their
crimes.</p>

<p>Labour enters into the system in all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
modifications, and as the rations of food supplied
to the prisoners are so calculated as to
be barely adequate to sustain life, they are
thus compelled, by the produce of their own
hands, to contribute to their own support.
According to the nature of their offences, the
proportion of their earnings which they receive
is more or less liberal; they are separated
into three classes:—1st. The <i>condamnés
aux travaux forcés</i>, who receive but
three tenths of their own gains; 2nd. the
<i>condamnés à la réclusion</i>, who receive four
tenths; and 3rd. the <i>condamnés correctionellement</i>,
who receive one half. The
amount of these wages may be seen to be
but small, when the sum paid for making
seven pair of <i>sabots</i>, or seven hours’ labour,
is but one penny. Of the sum allotted to
him, the criminal receives but one half immediately,
with which he is allowed to buy
bread, coffee, and some other articles at a
canteen established within the prison, under
strict regulations, and the other moiety is
deposited for his benefit in the savings’ bank
of the jail, to be paid to him with interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
on his enlargement. A prisoner, notwithstanding
his small wages, may, after seven
years’ confinement, have amassed one
hundred and twenty francs exclusive of interest.</p>

<p>The labour of the prison consists, in the
first place, of all the domestic work of the
establishment, its cleansing, painting and
repairs, its cooking, and the manufacture
of every article worn by the inmates; and
secondly, of yarn spinning, weaving and
making shirts for the little navy of Belgium,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
and drawers for the soldiers, together
with other similar articles suited for public
sale. Prisoners who have learned no
trade, are permitted to make their choice,
and are taught one. The cleanliness of
every corner is really incredible, and such
are its effects upon the health of the inmates,
that the deaths, on an average, do
not exceed, annually, one in a hundred.
After paying all its expenses of every description,
the profits of the labour done in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the prison leaves a surplus to the government,
annually, to an amount which I do
not precisely remember, but which is something
considerable.</p>

<p>Amongst the prisoners, one very old
man was pointed out to me, named Pierre
Joseph Soëte, seventy-nine years of age,
sixty-two of which he had spent within the
walls of this sad abode. He was condemned,
at the age of seventeen, for an
atrocious offence; in a fit of jealousy, he
had murdered a girl, to whom he was about
to have been married, by tying her to a
tree and strangling her. He entered the
jail when a boy, and had grown to manhood
and old age within its melancholy walls;
and the tenor of his life, I was told, had
been uniformly mild and inoffensive. Five
years since, the father of our friend, Count
D’Hane, who was then Governor of Ghent,
had represented the story to King Leopold,
and the unfortunate old man was set at
liberty; but in a few weeks, he presented
himself at the door of the prison, and begged
to be permitted to enter it again, and to die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
there as he had lived. I asked him why
he had taken this extraordinary resolution,
and he told me that the world had nothing
to detain him; he had no longer a relative
or a living face within it that he knew; he
had no home, no means of support, no
handicraft by which to earn it, and no
strength to beg, what could he do, but return
to the only familiar spot he knew, and
the only one that had any charms for him!
Poor creature! his extraordinary story, and
his long life of expiation, rendered it impossible
to remember or resent his early crime,
and yet I could not look at such a singular
being without a shudder.</p>

<p>Another, but a still more melancholy
case, was pointed out to me. I asked the
physician, Dr. Maresca, if there were any
foreigners in the jail, and he told me there
were several from Germany and France;
and one, an Englishman, who had been
confined some years before for an attempt
at fraud, and who, between chagrin and
disease, was now dying in the hospital. I
went to see him, and found him in bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
in the last feeble stage of consumption.
His story was a very sad one—his name
was Clarke, he seemed about thirty-five or
thirty-six years of age, and had come over
with his wife to seek for work as a machine
maker at one of the engine factories
in Ghent. He was disappointed—he could
get no adequate employment—he saw his
young wife and his little children perishing
from hunger in a strange land, and, in an
evil hour, he forged a document for some
trifling sum to procure them bread. He
was detected, tried and condemned to five
years’ imprisonment in the <i>maison de force</i>.
What became of his family he no longer
knew; they had, perhaps, returned to
England, but he could not tell. The physician
told me that his conduct had all
along been most excellent, so much so,
that the <span class="err" title="original: goverment">government</span> reduced the term of his
imprisonment from five years to four, and
he had now but eighteen months to remain.
But he was dying, and of a broken heart
through sorrow and mortification. The
physician had tried to obtain a further reduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
of his term; but it was not thought 
prudent at the time to accede to his representations,
and now it was too late to renew
the application. Dr. M. thought he
would now be liberated if the application
were repeated, but it was more humane,
he said, to leave him as he was, as he
had every attention he required; the hospital
was comfortable, and the rules of the
prison had all been relaxed in his favour,
so that he had books and every indulgence
granted to him, and a few weeks would
soon release him from all his sorrows.
Poor fellow! I hardly knew whether he
seemed gratified or grieved by our visit;
but his situation, surrounded by foreigners,
to whose very language he was a stranger,
far from home and England, and without a
friend or relation to watch his dying bed
was a very touching one, and it was rendered,
perhaps, more so, by the very sympathy
and kindness which seemed to be
felt for him by all around him.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the canal, we
visited the sugar refinery of M. Neyt. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
is a trade of much importance to Belgium,
and, like almost every other department of
her manufactures, at present in a very
critical condition. The establishment of M.
Neyt, though of great extent, being calculated
to work twenty-five tons of sugar in
the week, is not greater than some others
in Ghent, Antwerp and Brussels. The
machinery is all of the newest construction
for boiling <i>in vacuo</i>, upon Howard’s principle,
with some recent improvements by,
I think, M. Devos-Maes; which, though
expensive in the first instance, tends materially
to diminish the cost by accelerating
the completion of the process.</p>

<p>All the sugar we saw in process was
from Java and Manilla, and vessels were
loading in the canal in front of the works
with purified lump for Hamburgh. This
branch of Belgian commerce has been retarded
by a series of vicissitudes, and seems
still destined to perilous competition, not
only from Holland, which already disputes
the possession of the trade with her, but
from the states of the Prussian League in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
which there are eighty-four refineries of
sugar already. Holland and Belgium have,
for many years, enjoyed a large revenue
from this most lucrative process for the
supply of Germany and for export to the
Mediterranean; a manufacture in which
they have been enabled to compete successfully
with England, owing to their being at
liberty to bring the raw material from any
country where it is to be found cheapest,
whilst Great Britain has necessarily been
restricted to consume only the produce of
her own colonies by the protective duty
imposed upon all others. Holland has,
however, by her recent treaty with Prussia,
taken steps to preserve her present advantageous
position as regards the supply of
Germany, whilst her bounties to her own
refiners afford an equal encouragement
with that held out by their government to
those of Belgium.</p>

<p>The false policy of the system of bounties
has, however, operated in Belgium, as
it has invariably done elsewhere, to give an
unreal air of prosperity to the trade, whilst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
it opened a door to fraud, the never failing
concomitant of such unsound expedients.
To such an extent was this the case, that
on its recent detection and suppression, a
reaction was produced in the manufacture,
that for the moment threatened to be fatal.
The duty on the importation of raw sugar
amounts to 37 francs per 100 kilogrammes,
and a drawback was paid down to 1838 on
every 55 kilogrammes of refined sugar exported.
This proportion was taken as the
probable quantity extractible from 100 kilogrammes
of the raw article, but the law
omitted to state <i>in what stage</i> of refinement,
or of what precise quality that quantity
should be. The consequence was, that sugar
which had undergone but a single process,
and still retained a considerable weight of
its molasses, was exported, and a drawback
was thus paid upon the entire 75 to 80 kilogrammes,
which, had the process been completed,
would only have been demandable on
fifty-five. The encouragement designed to
give a stimulus to improvement, thus tended
only to give an impulse to fraud, and vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
quantities of half refined sugar were sent
across the frontiers, and the drawback paid,
only to be smuggled back again for a repetition
of the same dishonest proceeding.
The attention of the government being,
however, awakened by a comparison of the
relative quantities of raw sugar imported,
and of refined exported, on which the drawback
was claimed, a change was made in
the law in 1838, by which the drawback
was restricted to a per centage on nine
tenths only of the raw sugar imported,
thus securing a positive revenue upon the
balance, and at the same time some practical
expedients were adopted for the prevention
of fraud for the future. These latter
were found to be so effectual, that four establishments
in Antwerp discontinued the
trade altogether immediately on the new
law coming into force, and this example
was followed by others elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are still between 60 and 70 refineries
in Belgium, and in 1837 and 1838, the
importations of raw sugar and the exports
of refined were as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<p class="center">RAW SUGAR IMPORTED.</p>

 
<table><tr><td>In 1837.</td>   <td>20,128,618 kilogrammes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>In 1838.</td>   <td>16,814,940 kilogrammes.</td></tr>
 </table>

<p class="center">REFINED SUGAR EXPORTED.</p>

<table> 
<tr><td>In 1837.</td>   <td>8,484,097 kilogrammes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>In 1838.</td>   <td>8,113,897 kilogrammes.</td></tr>
 </table>

<p class="noin">An amount, which whilst it shows the general
importance of the trade, seems to indicate
that it is not increasing. The home
consumption of Belgium as compared to
England, is as 2 kils. per each individual to
8. In France the quantity used per head,
is 3 kils. and in the rest of Europe about
2½. But to the Belgians, this export trade
is the vital object at the present moment,
and any alteration of our law which would
permit the import of foreign sugar into
England, at a diminished duty, or encourage
the growth of beet-root for the manufacture
of sugar, would be fatal to the
trade of the Netherlands, and to Holland,
not less than to Belgium.</p>

<p>In the latter country, the production of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
sugar from beet-root, notwithstanding the
encouragement given to it by Napoleon,
was never very extended nor successful.
It disappeared almost entirely in 1814, and
was not revived for twenty years, till in
1834, a fresh impulse was given to the Belgians
to renew the experiment from witnessing
the example of its success in France
and some establishments were erected in
Brabant and Hainault. But the vast advantages
derived by the refiners of foreign
sugar from the facility for fraud afforded by
the defective state of the law, completely extinguished
the attempt. Even now the expense
of the process, which renders the cost
of the beet-root sugar nearly equal to that
extracted from the cane, together with the
inferiority for every purpose of the beet-root
molasses, holds out but little prospect
of its ever becoming a productive department
of national manufacture.</p>

<p>On the evening of our arrival, a considerable
tumult was excited around the front
of the <i>Hotel de la Poste</i> where we staid,
which we found arose from the eagerness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
to obtain admission to the new Theatre,
which stands next door to the Hotel, and
which was that evening to be opened for
the first time. Some soldiers were stationed
to keep off the crowd, but as their
impatience increased, the orders of the military
were but little regarded, till, at length,
the struggle came to an open rupture with
them, and the officer on guard after going
through all the preliminaries of intimidation,
expostulation and scolding, at length,
fairly lost all temper, and commenced boxing
“the leader of the movement!” A ring
being made for the combatants, the officer
was beaten, and walked off to his quarters,
and the pressure of the crowd, being by
this time relieved, the spectators hurried
into the theatre.</p>

<p>The new building is very magnificent; a
new street having been formed to open at
a suitable site for it, one side of which it
occupies exclusively. The centre of the
front, projects in the form of a wide semi-circle,
so that carriages drive right under
the building to set down their company at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the foot of the grand staircase. Besides
the theatre itself, there is a suite of halls
for concerts, capable of containing two
thousand persons, and the entire is finished
internally in the style of Louis XIV, with
a prodigality of colours, gilding, and ornamental
carving that is quite surprising. It
is certainly the most beautiful theatre I
have seen, as well as one of the most spacious.</p>

<p>The “<i>spectacle</i>” and the opera are still
amongst those necessaries in the economy
of life in Belgium, which late dinner
hours and fastidious taste have not as yet
interfered with. Ghent has long been
eminent for its successful cultivation of
music. A few years since, the <i>chefs d’orchestre</i>
in the four principal theatres in the
kingdom were all natives of Ghent, and
the names of Verheyen, Ermel and Angelet,
all born in the same place, are familiar to
every amateur of the science. The <i>Société
de St. Cecile</i>, a musical association, is the
most eminent in the Netherlands, and at a
concert at Brussels in 1837, where all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
musicians of the chief cities of the kingdom
competed for a prize; the first honours, two
golden medals were given by acclamation to
those of Ghent.</p>

<p>The print works of M. De Smet de Naeyer
are situated in the <i>Faubourg de Bruges</i>, and,
like almost all in the Netherlands, exhibit no
division of labour; the cotton being spun,
woven, and printed upon the same premises.
In the latter department, their productions
are of a very ordinary description, and their
designs in a very inferior class of art. The
machinery was partly French and partly
Belgian, of a cumbrous and antiquated
construction, compared with that in use in
England; but, as the recent improvements
in Great Britain have all been conceived
with a view to the speediest and cheapest
production to meet a most extensive demand,
their introduction into Belgium, where
the market is so extremely circumscribed,
would only be an augmentation of expense,
without any correspondent advantage. The
works were idle at the moment of our
visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>This important department of manufacture
is reduced to the lowest ebb in Belgium
by the effects of the revolution of
1830. Previous to this event, the Belgian
calico printer being admitted to the markets
of Holland and her colonies, had an outlet
for his produce, quite sufficient to afford
remunerative employment for all his machinery;
but when, by her separation from
Holland, Belgium was excluded from the
Dutch possessions, both in the East and
West Indies, and restricted to the supply of
her own population, she suddenly found the
number of her consumers reduced from
between <i>fifteen</i> and <i>sixteen millions</i> to something
less than <i>four</i>. In articles which are
universally produced by the unaided labour
<i>of the hand</i>, a limitation on the gross consumption
cannot, as a general rule, effect
any very material alteration in the individual
price, where fair competition shall
have already reduced and adjusted it by a
remunerative standard. But when it comes
to an active competition <i>with machinery</i>, the
case is widely different; the outlay for apparatus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and the cost of labour being almost 
the same for the production of one hundred
pieces as for ten, it is manifest that the
man who has a market for one hundred, can
afford to sell each one for a much less sum
than he who can only dispose of ten—even
without including in the calculation the interest
of the capital embarked, which must,
of course, be ten times the amount upon the
small production that it is upon the large.
It is her almost unlimited command of
markets, and the vast millions of consumers
who must have her produce, in her various
colonies and dependencies, that, combined
with her matchless machinery, places the
manufactures of England almost beyond the
reach of rivalry as regards the moderation
of their price; and thus gives them, in spite
of duties, that, in any other case, would
amount to a prohibition, a lucrative introduction
into those countries themselves,
which are fast acquiring her machinery, but
look in vain for her limitless markets.</p>

<p>The merchants of Antwerp and the
manufacturers of Ghent, had the good sense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
probably purchased by experience, to recognize
this incontrovertible principle, and
foreseeing, clearly, the ruin of their pursuits
in the results of the Repeal of the Union with
Holland, they loudly protested against the
proceedings of the revolutionists of 1830.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
But, as “madness ruled the hour,” their
protestations were all unheeded—they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
overborne by numbers; and, as the patriots
of Ireland, in rejecting the advantages held
out to them by Great Britain in the celebrated
“commercial propositions” of 1785,
adopted as their watchword “<i>perish commerce</i>,
but live the constitution;” so the
patriots of Belgium, in their paroxysm of
repeal, reproached their less frenzied fellow-countrymen
with “allowing the profits on
their cottons, or the prices of their iron, to
outweigh the independence of their country!”
The revolution was accomplished
in their defiance, and the ruin of their trade
was consummated by the same blow.</p>

<p>With respect to the very branch of manufacture
which has led to these observations,
the printing of calicoes and woollens, M.
Briavionne, an impartial historian, and so far
as political inclination is concerned, strongly
biassed in favour of the revolution, thus
details its immediate effects upon it. After
describing the rapid decline of the cotton
trade in general, since 1830, he goes on to
say, “In the department of printing, the
results have not been more satisfactory;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
many of the leading establishments of Ghent,
and of Brussels have been altogether abandoned,
or their buildings dismantled and
converted to other purposes, and their utensils
and machinery sold off by public auction.
Ghent, in 1829, possessed <i>fifteen</i>
print-works—in 1839 she had but <i>nine</i>; in
Brussels, at the same time, and in Ardennes
and Lierre, there were <i>eleven</i> houses of
the first rank, of these <i>six</i> have since closed
their accounts. Other establishments there
are, it is true, that have sprung up in the
interim, but, in the aggregate, the number
is diminished. In prosperous years, the production
of Belgium might have amounted,
before the revolution, to about 400,000
pieces. Ghent, alone, produced 300,000 in
1829, but its entire production, at present,
does not amount to 20,000, nor does that of
the largest house in Belgium exceed 45,000
pieces.</p>

<p>Nor is this to be ascribed to any want
of ability in the Belgian mechanics; on the
the contrary, they are qualified to undertake
the most difficult work, but they can only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
employ themselves, of course, when such
are in actual demand. They are, in consequence,
limited to the production of the
most low priced and ordinary articles; fast
colours and cheap cloth are all they aspire to.
High priced muslins they rarely attempt,
and although they have ventured to print
upon mousseline-de-laine, they have been
forced almost altogether to abandon it. In
fact, the double rivalry of France, on
the one hand, and England on the other,
keeps them in continual alarm, and renders
them fearful of the <span class="err" title="original: slighest">slightest</span> speculation or
deviation from their ordinary line of production.
France, on the contrary, enters
their market relying upon the elegance and
originality of her patterns; and England
notwithstanding her heavy and unimaginative
designs, conceived in inferior taste,
still maintains her superiority by means of
her masterly execution and the lowness of
her price. Thus, whilst French muslins sell
readily for from two to three francs an ell,
England can offer hers for forty-five centimes,
or even less, and those of Belgium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
vary from sixty centimes to a franc and a
quarter per ell; not only so, but for that
which she can now with difficulty dispose
of for sixty centimes, she had, thirty-five
years ago, an ample demand at two francs
and a half.</p>

<p>This destruction of her home trade by
the competition of foreigners, she has
sought in vain to retrieve by her shipments
abroad; she has exported to Brazil and to
the Levant, to the South Sea and Singapore,
and finally, she has turned to Germany
and the fairs of Francfort-on-the-Maine—in
short, she has tried every opening,
and found only loss in all. The only
market in which she has contrived to hold
a footing is that of Holland, and even this
is every day slipping from her, although,
before the revolution of 1830, it consumed
one half of her entire production.</p>

<p>Belgium has not, like England, manufacturers,
who, devoting themselves to the
supply of the foreign market alone, and
bestowing upon it their undivided study
and attention, attain a perfect knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
and command of it in its every particular;
but here, every printer looks to exportation
only as an expedient to get rid of his surplus
production, after satisfying the demand
of his home consumption. Such a system
is pregnant with evils, but it is in vain to
attempt its alteration so long as we have
England for our rival, with her great experience,
her vast command of capital, and
her firm possession of the trade.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The information which I received from
M. De Smet, M. Voortman, M. de Hemptine
and others, more than confirmed, in
its every particular, this deplorable exposé
of M. Briavionne. Belgian prints are constantly
undersold by from 10 to 15 per
cent by English goods, imported legitimately
into their market, notwithstanding a duty
of a hundred florins upon every hundred
kilogrammes, an impost which being assessed
by weight, falls heavily on that class
of goods which are the great staple of
England, and amounts to about <i>six shillings</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
upon a piece of the value of <i>fourteen</i>. Nor
is this all—their market is systematically
beset by smugglers across the frontiers of
France and Holland, who, inundating it
with French and English goods, exempt
from duty, have reduced the price of Belgian
production to an ebb utterly incompatible
with any hope of remuneration. This
is an evil, however, to which not their peculiar
branch alone, but every protected
manufacture in the country is equally
liable, and for redress of which they have
vainly invoked the interference of their
legislature—the mischief is of too great
magnitude to be grappled with or remedied.</p>

<p>The only relief which their government
has attempted, has been by the deplorable
expedient of themselves supplying capital
to sustain the struggle. A manufactory,
however, which they undertook to support,
at Ardennes-on-the-Meuse, constructed
with machinery upon English models, and
conducted by English managers, became
an utter failure and was abandoned;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
and in like manner, an association which
they had encouraged to attempt an export
trade, after numerous shipments to Portugal,
the Mediterranean, the East Indies,
South America, and the United States,
became utterly insolvent, and involved
the government in a loss of 400,000 francs.
In the mean time, England and France
monopolise the most profitable portions of
their trade, the latter supplying them, almost
exclusively with the more costly articles
of ornament and fancy, and the imports
of medium goods from the former
having been, in the first six months of the
present year, upwards of 17,000 pieces
more than in 1839.</p>

<p>This is one illustration, and I regret to
say, only one out of many of the ruinous effects
of the “Repeal of the Union,” In Ghent,
from its peculiar position and the active
genius of its population, its results have been
felt with more severity than elsewhere, though
its influence is discernible, to a greater or
less degree, in every quarter of Belgium. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
merchants of Ghent, however, make no
secret of their dissatisfaction, and exclaim
boldly against the indifference or incompetence
of the ministry to adopt measures
for their redress. In an especial degree,
their dissatisfaction manifests itself against
the present minister of the interior, M.
Liedtz, who having been a lawyer, is presumed
to be imperfectly acquainted with
commerce, and is said to be as unjustly
partial to agriculture, as he is coldly indifferent
to trade. One gentleman complained
bitterly that having, some time since, accompanied
a deputation to an interview
with the minister on the subject of the
decline of the cotton trade, M. Liedtz
abruptly ended the conference, almost before
they had opened their grievances,
by exclaiming:—“Come, now we have
heard enough about cotton—how are your
cows?”</p>

<p>In Ghent, business has always been conducted,
not only upon an extended scale,
but upon the most solid and steady basis;
bank accommodation and discounts are unknown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
in fact, in Belgium, and a bill, if 
drawn at all, is, as a general rule, held over
to maturity, and collected by the drawer.
This may, in a great degree, account for
the trifling balances which suffice to produce
a suspension of business. In an
annual document, published officially, I
presume, I perceive that although the number
of failures in Ghent for the year 1839,
amounted to twenty, the amount of their
united deficiencies did not exceed 198,000
francs.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>The sufferings of Ghent seem to be so
generally admitted, and so unequivocally
ascribed to the operation of the revolution,
that no scruple or delicacy is observed by
the press or the public in ascribing them
to its proper cause. A curious illustration
of this, we observed in a volume entitled,
“<i>Le Guide Indispensable du Voyageur sur les
Chemins de Fer de la Belgique</i>,” sold at all
the stations on the government railway,
and in the case in which I bought my copy,
by persons in the government uniform. In
a short notice of Ghent, it contains the following
passage of plain speaking upon this
point. “During the fifteen years of the
Dutch connexion, the population, the
wealth and the prosperity of Ghent never
ceased to increase; manufactures were multiplied,
streets enlarged, public buildings
erected, and large and beautiful houses
constructed; in short, Ghent had become
a great commercial city. <i>The revolution of
1830 at once arrested this career of improvement,
and Ghent, whose prosperity was the
offspring of peace and of her connexion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Holland, now seems to protest, by her silence,
against a change which she finds to be fraught
to her with ruin.</i> The citadel was only
taken when all hope had disappeared of
maintaining the supremacy of King William;
but,” adds the author, “it is to be
hoped that, little by little, the influence of
new institutions may rally the hopes of the
Gantois, and, at last, reconcile them to the
consequences of the Belgian revolution.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
And the new institution which is to achieve
such a triumph, is to be, of course, <i>the
railroad</i> from Ostend to Cologne.</p>

<p>Our stay at Ghent had been somewhat
longer than our original intention, but we
found it a place abounding in attractions,
not only from its hereditary associations,
but from the enterprising and ingenious
character of its inhabitants, and the progress
which they have achieved in their
multifarious pursuits. Besides, it is always
a matter of the deepest interest to observe
the success or failure of a great national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
experiment, such as is now in process in
Belgium, where, after an interval of upwards
of two centuries, during which they
have formed a portion of another empire,
its inhabitants are testing the practicability
of restoring and supporting their old national
independence, notwithstanding all
the changes which two hundred years have
produced in the policy, the commerce, and
the manufacturing power of Europe—changes
not less astonishing than those
which, almost within the same interval, the
discovery of printing has produced in the
diffusion of learning, or that of gunpowder
in the system of ancient warfare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> again availed ourselves of the railroad
from Ghent to Brussels, starting
from the Monk’s Meadow at eight o’clock
in the morning, and made the journey
in about three hours and a half. The
route is considerably increased in length,
owing to the line making an angle in
order to traverse Malines, which has
been made a centre at which every
branch of the entire system converges
and take a fresh departure. This arrangement
may be a convenience to the
directory, but it is an annoyance to the
public, not only by the extension of the
distance they have to travel, but by
the scene of bustle, confusion, and risk
created by the concourse of so many
trains at the same point, the nuisance
and danger of which can hardly be exaggerated;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
engines bellowing, horns sounding, 
luggage moving, and crowds rushing
to secure their places in the departing
train, or to escape from being run over
by the one coming in.</p>

<p>The aspect of the country was, in all
directions, the same—tame, but rich and
luxuriant, with vessels toiling along its
tributary canals, and here and there the
Scheldt making its tortuous windings
through long lines of pines and alders.
One thing strikes a stranger as singular
in this province, the almost total absence
of pasture land, and the appearance of
no cattle whatsoever in the fields, the
ground being found to be more valuable
under cultivation, and cattle more economically
fed within doors. The railroad
passes by some pretty but unimportant
villages, such as Wetteren and Auderghem,
before arriving at Termonde, more familiarly
known to us as the Dendermonde
of my Uncle Toby’s military commentaries.
At Auderghem, a road turns to the right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Alost, one of the most flourishing towns
of East Flanders, and a prosperous seat of
the flax and linen trade.</p>

<p>After passing Dendermonde, we entered
the province of Brabant, at the little village
of Hombech, and the train, after traversing
Lehendael (the Valley of Lillies), stopped
at Mechlin, whose towers had been visible
long before reaching the station. One of
the most conspicuous objects here, is an
immense brick building, erected in 1837 or
38, for the purpose of spinning linen yarn,
but never having been applied by its proprietors
to that purpose, has lately been
purchased by an English gentleman, Mr.
Fairburne, to be converted into a manufactory
of machinery, a department of manufacture
which, in the present state of
of Belgium, I much fear is not likely to
prove more encouraging.</p>

<p>From Malines to Brussels, the distance is
fifteen miles, and was performed in something
less than half an hour, the road lying
through broad meadows and more extensive
pastures than any I have yet seen in Belgium.
On the left, these plains swell into a gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
hill of some miles in length, on which the
towers and steeples of Brussels are discernible
long before we approach them.
Within a few miles of Malines, we passed
Vilvorde, an ancient place, but now only
remarkable for its vast prisons, which are
seen at a considerable distance. It was at
Vilvorde that Tindal, the first translator
of the Bible into English, was burned for
heresy in 1536.</p>

<p>Before arriving at the termination of the
journey, the road sweeps along between
two gentle elevations, that on the left being
covered with the villas and pleasure-grounds
of Schaerbeek, the Hampstead of Brussels,
and to the right, with the woods and palace
of Schoenberg, near the village of Laeken,
a favourite residence of King Leopold. It
was built in 1782, by the Archduke Albert,
for the sister of the unhappy Marie
Antoinette, and to serve for the future
residence of the Austrian governor of the
Netherlands. It suffered during the saturnalia
of the French revolution, when a
lofty tower, which rose above the woods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
that surround it, was torn down and sold
for the price of the materials. Napoleon was
partial to the palace as a summer retreat,
and it was whilst lingering here with Marie
Louise, that he completed the final and fatal
arrangements for the invasion of Russia. It
is handsomely, rather than magnificently
furnished, but the grounds and gardens,
which have all been re-modelled in the
English style, are amongst the most beautiful
in Europe, and command extensive
views of the broad wooded campagne of
Brabant, and the cheerful heights and
gothic towers of Brussels.</p>

<p>The first sight of Brussels, on approaching
it from the side of Malines, is well calculated
to give a favourable impression of its beauty
and extent, the long planted line of the
Allée Vert, terminating at the handsome
gate d’Anvers, (formerly the Porte Guillaume,
before the change of dynasty), with
its dark iron balustrade and gilded capitals,
and in front, the steep acclivity covered
with streets and buildings of the modern
and more elegant town, whilst the turrets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
of the Hôtel de Ville and the towers of St.
Gudule are equally conspicuous, rising
above the roofs of the ancient city which
nestles at its base. The city itself, though
of remote antiquity, has nothing very antique
in its first appearance, and, in fact,
it is only in the narrow alleys and passages
of the lower quarter that the mansions and
municipal buildings of the former nobles
and burghers of Brabant are to be discerned.
Even here there are fewer architectural
traces of the magnificence of the
middle ages than in almost any other of the
great cities of Belgium. The Grand Place is
a splendid exception to this observation, as
it is surrounded on all sides with lofty old
Spanish-looking houses, in the style, at
least, if not of the date of the palmy days
of Brabant, its high peaked roofs bristling
with tiers of little grim windows, its
pointed gables covered with bas-reliefs and
carvings, and the ample fronts of its mansions
richly decorated with arabesques in
stone, which had once been gaudily coloured,
and here and there tipped with gold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
On one side starts up to a surprising height
the gothic tower of the Hôtel de Ville, by
far the most beautiful in the Low Countries,
and on the opposite one is a vast gloomy-looking
building, now converted into shops,
which was once the <i>Maison Communale</i> of
the city; and being rebuilt by the Infanta
Isabella, in the early part of the seventeenth
century, was, in commemoration of
the deliverance of Brussels from the plague,
dedicated to Notre Dame de la Paix, with
an inscription, which is still legible, though
much defaced: “<i>A peste, fame et bello libera
nos Maria pacis</i>.”</p>

<p>It is in the narrow and dingy passages of
this lower town, that a stranger feels all the
associations of the olden time around him;
but on ascending by the steep and precipitous
streets to the modern quarter, with its
light and beautiful houses, its open squares
and gardens, with their fountains and statues,
and all that is French and fashionable,
the charm of association is gone, and one
feels something like coming suddenly into
the daylight from the dim scenery of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
melodrame. To the stranger in Brussels
there are, therefore, two distinct sets of
objects of attraction. In the new town
there are the palaces of the King and the
nobles, the park, the public promenades, the
chambers of the Senate and the Commons,
the splendid hotels of the Place Royal, and
the libraries and museums that occupy
the château which was once the residence
of the Austrian viceroys; whilst in the old
town, there are the churches of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, with their
superb oak carvings, stained windows and
statuary, the Hôtel de Ville, the gloomy
old mansions of the past race of nobles,
and all the characteristic memorials of the
ancient capital. The first are speedily disposed
of by the tourist, as there is nothing
unique in any of the lions of Brussels, its inhabitants
are, in fact, anxious to have their
city considered a miniature Paris, and it
seems to have been laid out altogether on the
model of the French capital, with its boulevards
and its palace gardens, its opera,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
its restaurants and its “café des milles colonnes.”</p>

<p>The churches, are, as usual, splendid specimens
of gorgeous altars, (with their ponderous
candelabra and Madonnas in embroidered
petticoats,) solemn aisles, marble
columns, painted ceilings, Flemish pictures
and carved pulpits, so flowing and graceful
in their execution, that they look as if the
Van Hools and Van Bruggens of former
times, possessed some secret for fusing the
knotted oak and pouring it into moulds to
form their statues and their wreathes of flowers.
Their Pulpits are, in reality, one of the
wonders of the Netherlands, they are of immense
dimensions, some of them reaching
almost as high as the gothic arches which
separate the nave from the side aisles.
The lower department usually represents
some appropriate scene from the events
of sacred history, the expulsion of Adam
and Eve from Paradise, Elijah fed by
ravens, the conversion of St. Paul, with
the frightened horse most vigorously introduced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
or Christ calling Peter and Andrew, 
who are represented in their boat by the
sea-shore, with their nets and fish, all exquisite
specimens of the art; and, occasionally,
the designs are allegorical, with
figures of Time, Truth and Christianity.
Above these, usually rises a rock, or
a mass of foliage and flowers, on which
are perched birds and other accompaniments,
and on this rests the shell of the
pulpit, the whole is then surmounted, either
by a canopy sustained by angels and cherubims,
or by the spreading branches of a
palm tree, so arranged as to overshadow
the whole. Almost every great church and
cathedral in Belgium contains one of these
unique productions of an art which is now
almost extinct, or, at least, possessed of no
practitioners at all qualified to cope in excellence
with these ancient masters. The confessionals,
altars and organs are likewise
elaborately covered with these almost unique
decorations, and even the doors and windows
sometimes exhibit specimens of extraordinary
beauty and value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span></p>

<p>The <i>church of St. Gudule</i>, which is the
most remarkable at Brussels, has two huge
gothic towers, each nearly the same height
with St. Pauls, and from their solid and
massy construction looking even more stupendous;
but the effect is seriously injured
by a number of ordinary houses, which
have been permitted to be erected against
the very walls of the building!—a curious
instance of the absence of all taste in the
ecclesiastical body, who can thus permit,
for money, the actual defacement of their
finest building. The pillars which sustain
the roof within, bear each in front a colossal
statue, of which there are fourteen or
sixteen representing the various saints and
apostles, some of them by Duquesnoy and
Quellyn, but the generality of inferior merit.
The pulpit was carved by Van Bruggen in
1699, and was presented to the cathedral
by the Empress Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>The windows which are of dimensions
proportioned to the huge scale of the church
are all of rich stained glass, partly antique
and partly of modern execution, but of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
brilliancy of tint and high talent in design.
The high altar is so composed by some ingenious
machinery within, that the sacred
wafer descends apparently of itself, at the
moment when the host is about to be elevated
by the officiating priest.</p>

<p>Around the choir are the monuments of
some of the ancient Dukes of Brabant, surmounted
by their effigies in armour, with
swords and helmets disposed by their side;
that of John II, who married Margaret of
England, and died in 1318, bears a figure of
the Belgic lion in gilded bronze, which
weighs nearly three tons. Opposite this is
another to the memory of the Archduke
Ernest of Austria, on which rests a figure
clad in mail. Close by it a marble slab
in the floor covers the vault in which are
interred some members of the imperial
family who died during their vice-royalty at
Brussels.</p>

<p>One statue in St. Gudule is remarkable
as a favourable specimen of modern art in
Belgium, it is that of the Count Frederick
de Merode, a young nobleman of most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
amiable personal character, whose father was
of one of the ancient families of Brabant,
and his mother a Grammont. On the outburst
of the revolution in 1830, he returned
from France, where he was residing, enrolled
himself as a volunteer in a corps of
sharpshooters raised by the Marquis de
Chasteler, and was killed whilst leading
a charge against the Dutch rear-guard,
under the command of Duke Bernard of
Saxe Weimar. This monument is by Geefs
of Brussels, who has evinced equal judgment
and ability in retaining the national
blouse as the costume of his statue, and
yet so disposing it as to render it perfectly
classical by his arrangement. Geefs is by
far the most distinguished artist, as a sculptor,
in Belgium, and has recently erected
a spirited statue of General Belliard in the
Park overlooking the Rue Royale, and
the grand monument over the remains of
the revolutionary partisans, who fell in the
three glorious days “of 1830,” and are
interred in the centre of the <i>Place des
Martyrs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span></p>

<p>The other churches of Brussels contain
little that is worth a visit. In that of Notre
Dame de la Chapelle, there is a high altar
from a design by Rubens, one of those
works in which he has so profusely exhibited
his astonishing command of arabesque
and allegorical devices. The pulpit is
another specimen of wood carving, representing
Elijah fed by ravens. It is remarkable
that in all the churches of Brussels,
there is not a single painting of more than
common place ability, nor a single specimen
of either Vandyck or Rubens—painters,
it would seem, like prophets, are to seek
for their patrons at some distance from
home.</p>

<p>The municipal collections of art are deposited
in the museum and picture gallery
in the Palais des Beaux Arts, formerly the
vice-regal residence of the Austrian governors.
In one wing of the building,
called the Palais d’Industrie, are deposited
models of machinery, agricultural instruments,
and inventions of all kinds applicable
to manufactures. The collection is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
costly and extensive, and cannot fail to exercise
a beneficial influence in the education
of mechanics. The main galleries of the
palace are filled with the national pictures,
which amount to between three and four
hundred. The description of a painting is
scarcely more intelligible or satisfactory than
the description of an overture. Amongst
the collection are a few of considerable
merit, but the vast majority are of the most
ordinary description. There are a few by Rubens
and Vandyck, not of the first order,
some by Breughel, Cuyp, Gerard Dow, and
the chiefs of that school; a multitude by
the Crayers and Van Oorts and Vander
Weydes, whose works one meets in every
Flemish chapel, and a number of the early
painters of the Netherlands, in which, I
confess, I am not connoisseur enough to
discover anything very attractive beyond
their antiquity and curiosity as specimens
of the feeble efforts of art in its infancy.</p>

<p>Under the same roof is the magnificent
Library, begun by the Dukes of Burgundy
so far back as the fourteenth century, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
enriched by every subsequent sovereign of
the Netherlands, till its treasures now
amount to 150,000 volumes of printed
books and 15,000 manuscripts; amongst
which are numbers whose pedigree through
their various possessors is full of historical
interest, and some which belonged to the
library of Philip the Hardy, in 1404, and
described in the “<i>Inventoire des livres et
roumans de feu Monseigneur</i> (<i>Philip le
Hardi</i>), <i>a qui Dieu pardonne, que maistre
Richart le Conte, barbier de feu le dict
Seigneur, a euzen garde</i>.” Its chief treasures
it owes, however, to Philip the Good,
the Lorenzo de Medicis of the Low Countries,
who attracted to his court such geniuses
as Oliver de la March, Monstrelet,
Philip de Commines, the chroniclers and
men of learning of his time, and kept constantly
in his employment the most able
“clerks,” “<i>escripvains</i>” and illuminators,
engaged in the preparation of volumes
for his “librarie,” and having united
all the provinces of the Netherlands under
his dominion, he collected at Brussels the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
manuscripts of the Counts of Flanders, in
addition to his own. The identical copy of
the Cyropedia of Xenophon, which he had
transcribed for the study of his impetuous
son, Charles le Téméraire, and which
accompanied him to the disastrous field of
Morat, is still amongst the deposits in this
superb collection.</p>

<p>Another of its illustrious founders was
Margaret of Austria, <i>la gente demoiselle</i>,
daughter to the gentle-spirited Mary of
Burgundy, and friend of Erasmus and Cornelius
Agrippa, who amassed for it the
invaluable collection of “<i>Princeps</i>” editions,
which were then issuing from the early
press of Venice and the North. The Library
still contains the common-place book
of this interesting Princess, with her verses
in her own handwriting, and music of her
own composition.</p>

<p>Another equally charming guardian of
literature was her niece, Mary of Austria,
the sister of Charles V and Queen Dowager
of Hungary, who transferred to the library
of Brussels the manuscripts which her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Louis II, had inherited from his 
grandfather, Mathias Corvinus. Amongst
these, is a missal, one of the wonders of
the collection, painted at Florence in 1485,
and abounding in the most exquisite miniatures,
arabesques and illuminated cyphers.
From the period of its deposit in Brussels,
the Dukes of Brabant took their oath of
inauguration by kissing the leaves of this
priceless volume, and two pages which had
been opened for this purpose at the accession
of Albert and Isabella, in November
1599, are spotted with the flakes of snow
which fell upon the book during the solemnity.</p>

<p>In the vicissitudes of Brussels, the contents
of her Library has always been an
object of cupidity for her invaders. In
1746, Marshal Saxe sent a selection of its
treasures to Paris, which were restored in
1770, and again seized by the revolutionary
army of Dumourier in 1794, and though
recovered in 1815, it was with the loss of
many of its precious deposits. But even
the disappearance of these was less exasperating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
than the insensate vandalism of the 
savants of the revolution, who actually
rubbed out with their wetted fingers, the
portraits of the ancient emperors and kings,
and even of the saints who happened to
wear a crown, in order to evince their inexpressible
hatred of monarchy.</p>

<p>Amongst the manuscripts, are some few
which escaped from the sack of Constantinople
in 1453, and bear the names and
handwriting of Chalcondylas, Chrysolaras,
and the restorers of Grecian literature, who,
on the overturn of the Eastern Empire,
found a refuge at Rome and at the court of
the Medicis. The bindings of numbers of
them, bear the imperial cypher of Napoleon,
but the majority have still their ancient
velvet covers, the richness of which,
with their clasps of gilded silver which secure
them, attest the value which was
placed upon their contents by their illustrious
owners.</p>

<p>An adjoining apartment is devoted to
some interesting antiquities, among which,
are a court-dress of Charles II, a souvenir
of his sojourn at Brussels during the ascendancy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
of Cromwell; a cloak of feathers, 
which belonged to Montezuma; the cradle
in which Charles V. was rocked; and
two stuffed horses which bore Albert and
Isabella at the battle of Nieuport, one an
Andalusian barb which had accompanied
the Infanta from Spain, the other a Moravian
which afterwards saved the life of
the Archduke at the siege of Ostend in
1604.</p>

<p>In the private mansions of Brussels there
are numerous collections of pictures and
objects of vertu, much more valuable than
those which are the property of the nation.
Those of the Duke d’Aremberg, the Prince
de Ligne, M. Maleck de Werthenfels, and
the Count Vilain XIV, contain several
masterpieces of the Dutch and Flemish
masters, and some few by Raphael Leonardo
de Vinci, and the chiefs of the Italian
school. The name of this latter gentleman
is somewhat remarkable; his ancestor, who
was ennobled by Louis XIV, being permitted
to append the cypher of the monarch
to his name and that of his descendants.
The collection of the Duke d’Aremberg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
besides a number of paintings of great excellence,
contains a remarkable marble,
which has excited much curious investigation
amongst the dilettanti; it is a head,
the fragment of a statue, which <i>is said</i> to
have originally belonged to the main figure
in the group of the Laocoon in the Vatican,
the present head being only a restoration.
The truth of this is questioned, but the connoisseurs
attached to Napoleon were so
satisfied of its truth, that the Emperor, by
their advice, offered the possessor, weight for
weight, gold for marble, if he would allow
the head to resume its ancient position on
the shoulders of the statue which was then
in the gallery of the Louvre. The Duke,
unwilling to part with it, declined, but
aware of the determined nature of Napoleon’s
caprices, sent it privately out of the
country, and had it concealed at Dresden
till the fall of the Emperor, when it was
restored to its old place in the library of
the Palais d’Aremberg. That the head of
the central figure in the group of the Vatican
is a restoration, there can be no doubt;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
it was copied, it is said, from an antique
gem. The head at Brussels, was found by
some Venetian explorers, and sold to the
father or grandfather of the present Duke
d’Aremberg. Whether it be the genuine
original or not, no possible doubt can be
entertained of its masterly execution, and
the vigour and fire of expression with which
it glows, justify any opinion in favour of its
origin.</p>

<p>An almost precipitous street, appropriately
called “Rue Montagne de la
Cour,” rises in a straight line from the
lowest level of the ancient town to the hill
on which the new one is situated, which
is filled with the best and most showy shops
in Brussels; jewellers, printsellers, confectioners
and modistes, and crowded at all
hours of the day with carriages and fashionable
loungers. At the bottom of this steep
acclivity, is the Place de la Monnaie, where
stands the theatre, in which the actual
insurrection commenced in 1830, when
the audience, inflamed by the music and
declamation of the Muette de Portici, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
inspired by the estro of Masaniello, rushed
into the street and proceeded at once to demolish
the residence of the minister, M.
van Maanen. Turning a corner from this,
one finds himself suddenly in the midst of
the antique square in which stands the
Hôtel de Ville, and the other principal municipal
edifices of the past age—the <i>forum</i>
of ancient Brabant, as the Place de Monnaie
is of the modern. It was in this and
in the sombre old mansions that are to be
found in the precincts around it, that the
pride of democracy appears to have delighted
in “recording in lofty stone” its
own magnificence, and lavished their public
wealth upon the towers of the Town
Hall, the most imposing monument of the
popular power.</p>

<p>But, independently of its democratic
associations, the Hôtel de Ville of Brussels
was the scene of the most extraordinary
episode that has ever been recorded in the
chronicles of kings;—it was in the grand
hall of the Hôtel de Ville that Charles V.
wearied with the crown of a monarch, laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
it aside to assume the cowl of a monk, and
took his departure from the throne of an
empire to die, a maniac, in the cell of a
monastery. It was from one of the windows
of the same building that the ferocious
Duke of Alva looked on, in person, at the
execution of two of the purest patriots of
their own or any subsequent age—Lamoral,
Count Egmont, and Philip de Montmorency,
Count Horn—the first and most illustrious
martyrs of the Reformation in the Netherlands.
During the reign of terror under
Philip II., Brussels was the grand scene
of Alva’s atrocities and of his successors’
incapacity. It was in the little square of
the Petit Sablon, that the protestant confederates
assembled to draw up their famous
remonstrance to Margaret of Parma, the
sister and vice-queen of the bigotted tyrant,
on the occasion of presenting which, by the
hands of de Bredérode, the unlucky exclamation
of “the beggars,” (<i>Gueux</i>) escaped
from the incautious lips of the Count de
Berlayment, in whispering his counsel to
the grand-duchess to reject their prayer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
a word which fell like a blister, and was
adopted, at once, as the title and the sting
of the protestant conjuration.</p>

<p>The square of the Hôtel de Ville was the
scene of every popular commotion that has
agitated Brabant, from the origin of the
ducal dynasty, to the halcyon days of
Albert and Isabella: it resounded with the
insane riots of the Iconoclasts in 1566, and
it was illuminated by the flames of the Inquisition,
in which the same infuriated
fanatics made a final expiation for their
violence. It ran red with the blood of
the protestants under Philip II.; and,
in 1581, it rang with the acclamations
of the followers of the Prince of Orange
over the temporary abolition of the worship
of Rome. So little is its architectural aspect
altered since these thrilling scenes,
that, with the Hôtel de Ville on one side,
and on the other the old communal house,
in which Egmont and Horn spent the night
previous to their execution; and around
them the venerable gothic fronts and fretted
gables of its ancient dwellings, one might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
almost imagine it the ready scenery, and
half expect the appearance of the dramatis
personæ to re-enact the tragedy.</p>

<p>The ornamental monuments of Brussels
are neither very numerous, nor remarkable
for their refinement of taste. The public
fountain called “le Cracheur,” is the statue
of a man, with his arms folded, and vomiting
the stream for the accommodation of
the public; and the famous little fountain
of the <i>mannekin</i>, in the Rue de
Chene, supplies her customers with water
in a style perfectly unique, at least, in a
statue. This eccentric little absurdity is
the darling of the bourgeoisie, and the popular
palladium of Brussels, and its memoirs
are amongst the most ridiculous records of
national trifling. The original which was
of great antiquity, made of carved stone was
replaced by one of iron. The present one is
in bronze on the same model, and was cast
by Duquesnoy in 1648. One story to account
for its extreme popularity, is that it
is a likeness of Godfrey, one of the Dukes
of Brabant, who, when an infant, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
escaped from his nurse, was discovered at
the spot in the attitude immortalized by
the little statue. By the mob, the mannekin
is perfectly worshipped—he is called “le
plus ancien bourgeois de la ville,” has the
freedom of the city, and a feast day in July
regularly appointed in his honour. On
this occasion, he is clothed in a suit which
was given him by Louis XV., consisting of
a cocked hat and feathers, a sword and costume
complete, the King, at the same time,
creating him a Chevalier de St. Louis.
Charles V. was equally beneficent to the
mannekin, and Maximilian of Bavaria assigned
him a valet-de-chambre. He has
also been left legacies by more than one of
the citizens; at the present moment his
income is upwards of four hundred francs,
paid to his valet for his services upon state
occasions, and to a treasurer for the management
of his estates. Brussels has, more
than once, been thrown into dismay by the
mannekin being carried off, and the utmost
exertion has been made for his recovery.
The last violence offered to him was his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
being carried off a few years since; but he
was discovered in the house of a liberated
felon, and speedily restored to his old place
and functions amidst the delight of the
Brussellois.</p>

<p>In the Place du Grand Sablon, another
fountain, surmounted by a marble statue of
Minerva, between figures, representing Fame
and the river Scheldt, and holding a medallion
with the heads of Francis I. and Maria
Theresa was erected, as its inscription imports
in 1711, by Thomas Bruce, Earl of
Aylesbury, in recognition of the enjoyments
he had experienced during a residence of
forty years in Brussels.</p>

<p>We dined to day with the gentlemen who
formed the Commission of Inquiry which
had lately visited the linen districts of Great
Britain. The entertainment was at du
Bos’, Rue Fossé-aux-Loups, the favourite
restaurant of Brussels, and the dinner was
altogether French, and equal to the best
cuisine of the Palais Royale. The hotels of
Brussels, those, I mean, in its upper town,
are on an immense scale, especially the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Bellevue, which overlooks the park, and
was in the very focus of the fight during the
“glorious three days” of 1830. Beside it
is the Hôtel de Flandres, said to have the
most recherché table-d’hôte of the entire,
and such is its popularity, that we could
neither obtain apartments in the hotel on
our arrival, nor seats at the table on a subsequent
occasion. In this dilemma, we took
up our residence at a house on the opposite
side of the same square, the Hôtel Brittanique,
where we found the arrangements
as execrable, in every respect, as the charges
were monstrous. As usual, however, a
stranger with his foot on the step of his
carriage, has no resource but to submit; but,
as a general rule, the traveller who is in
search of the <i>cheapest</i> hotel, should invariably
address himself to that which has
the reputation of being the <i>best</i>; where
there is no temptation, as in the less frequented
establishments, to make those who
visit the house pay for the loss occasioned
by the absence of those who avoid it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
where, even if the bill be occasionally something
more than is equitable, he has, at least,
the satisfaction of feeling that he has had
<i>comfort</i> in exchange for extortion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> this morning paid a visit to M.
Liedtz, the minister of the interior, in his
hotel at the “Palais de la Nation.” It is
rather remarkable that neither the actual
eruption of the revolution nor its subsequent
influence, has been sufficient to draw
forth any individual of leading genius, to
give a complexion to the policy of the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
state. The actors who have played the
most prominent <i>rôle</i> during the last ten
years have been a few of the ancient
Catholic noblesse, whose titles gave éclat
to the movement, but who have long since
withdrawn into retirement, or ceased to
take a lead in the administration—and the
body of lawyers whose professional aptitude
to promote or profit by any change,
has enabled them to step over the heads of
their less adroit, but not less qualified associates,
and to appropriate to themselves
the “loaves and fishes” of office. Lastly,
there were “the masses” whose impetuosity
achieved the revolution, the “patrioterie”
who form the tools of every revolution
to be worked for the benefit of their
more clear sighted superiors. But the
daring spirits of 1830 have all disappeared;
the present times do not require such
fiery agents; the violence which effects a
revolution, must be the first thing to be got
rid of by those who would perpetuate it,
and who speedily learn to exchange the
exciting demand of “<i>delenda est Carthago</i>,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
for the milder supplication of “<i>panem et
Circenses</i>.” In this way the Masaniello
of the revolution, M. de Potter, having been
given to comprehend that his services had
been rendered, and his presence no longer
desirable, has long since withdrawn himself
to ponder over, and, it is even added, <i>to
regret</i> the events of 1830; but certainly to
lament, in strong terms, his disappointment
at their practical results.</p>

<p>The present ministry did not, from all
we could observe, command the confidence
of their fellow citizens, nor do I recollect
any one of them spoken of without a reference
to some incapacity or disqualification
for the office. M. Rogier, the minister of
public works, had been a third or fourth
rate barrister at Liege, and eked out an
insufficient professional income by delivering
lectures on French literature. His
daring and energetic share in the events
which displaced the old dynasty, recommended
him to employment under the new,
but the office assigned to him, that of the
interior, involving the guardianship of trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
and manufactures, was one for which he
was little suited, either by education or
taste, and he utterly destroyed the confidence
of the merchants and mill owners, by
avowing in one of his addresses to them,
that they must be prepared to see “<i>commerce
die a lingering death</i>,” if it were
conducive to the permanence of the new
order of things. M. Liedtz, with whom
we had an interview this morning, had, like
M. Rogier, been a lawyer, but of some
standing and eminence in his profession.
He had been, we heard, unfavourable to
the revolution at its first out-break, but
his talents speedily recommended him to
the notice of the new authorities, who promoted
him to be judge in the district of
Antwerp, whence he was transferred to his
present office on the removal of M. Rogier,
to that of public works. He received us in a
suite of very elegant apartments, much superior
to those with which our own ministers
are accommodated in Downing Street. He
is a native of Audenarde, of humble parentage,
but of considerable practical acquirements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
especially on agricultural matters. 
He received us most affably, and after some
conversation on commercial subjects, reverted
at once to his own hobby, by asking
after the progress of agriculture in Great
Britain. The object of greatest interest
with us was the duty which it had been
announced that it was in contemplation by
the government to impose upon the export
of flax, and to which I have before alluded
as the extraordinary expedient suggested
by the agricultural members of the
chambers, in order to protect the hand spinners
from being superseded by machinery.
The minister seemed fully to understand the
absurdity of the suggestion, but still admitted
that the “pressure from without” might compel
him to introduce a bill upon the subject.
He informed us, that a negociation has just
been concluded with some speculators in
the United States, supported by the Belgian
government, with a view to running
a line of steam-packets of great power from
New York and Philadelphia to Antwerp and
Ostend, touching at one of the southern
ports of England, and thus it was expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
securing a share of the passenger trade, as
well as opening, by degrees, a market for
Belgian produce in the United States.</p>

<p>One thing, in Belgium, I cannot but allude
to as characteristic—the unrestrained freedom
with which every individual discusses
politics, and the unreserved candour
and frankness with which each details his
views and strictures. This is the more
remarkable, because the universal tenor of
opinion is, if not directly to complain, at
least, to admit the existence of much cause
for complaint. I never met with less
<i>bigotted</i> politicians, and I have not seen a
single individual, whom I would designate
<i>a party-man</i>, in the English acceptation of
the term, that is one who finds all right, or
all wrong, precisely as the party with whom
he sympathises be censured or lauded by
the inference. But the fact is, there are no
“optimists” in Belgium as yet, and there
is so much that is unsatisfactory in every
department, that the consciousness of it
forces itself upon the conviction, if not the
admission of every individual. The press,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
too, is equally unreserved, and in the shops
of the booksellers, we found numbers of
publications devoted to the exposure of the
present condition of the country.</p>

<p>Still no creature, not even the most
violent partisan of the House of Nassau
whom I have met with, includes King
Leopold in the scope of his censures.
The revolution itself, its immediate agents
and its consequences are the objects of
their condemnation; but no one of the
results from which they suffer, is ascribed
to the influence or interference of the King.
Those who regret the expulsion of the King
of Holland, look upon King Leopold
merely as his involuntary successor, and
whilst they condemn the incapacity of his
ministers, and the violence of the party in
the house and in the country by whom
they are controlled—all seemed to regard
the King as only borne upon a tide of
circumstances, which he is equally unable
with them to resist or direct. His fondness
for locomotion, his frequent visits to
England and journeys to Paris, were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
subject of good humoured badinage, and
have procured him the titles of “<i>le
roi voyageur</i>,” and “<i>l’estafette nomade</i>.”
“Il s’amuse,” said an intelligent Belgian,
when I asked him what share the King
took in politics, “he goes out of the way
to Wiesbaden, and leaves things very much
to themselves, or, what is nearly the same
thing <i>to his ministers</i>.”</p>

<p>In Brussels, of course, we found the
revolution still popular; its population
were the first to promote, and are the last
to regret it. But it is an inland town, the
residence of the court and the nobles, unconnected
either with manufactures or commerce,
and its shopkeepers have not
suffered by the change, which has affected
the prosperity of the trading districts.
Equally independent of the loom and the
sail, they only hear of the embarrassments
of others, as a sound from a distance.
Their intercourse is with the wealthy, who
are congregated round the seat of the
legislation and the palace of the sovereign;
as yet their pursuits have not been affected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
by the diminished resources of the middle
and labouring classes, and besides the
constant passage of strangers, as well as the
permanent residence of some thousands of
English and other wealthy foreigners, is a
permanent source of income. But, throughout
the country and in the provincial
towns, we met with but one feeling of keen
discontent with the result of the revolution,
and alarm for the condition and prospects
of the country.</p>

<p>That the union of Belgium with Holland in
1815 was one conceived, less with an eye to
the interests of the two countries, than in an
anxiety for the erection of a substantial
power in that precise locality, as a security
for the peace of Europe, is admitted by all
engaged in its actual arrangements; but
it is equally admitted, that whatever discordances
there might have existed at the
time between the feelings, the peculiarities
and the interests of the two states, they
presented no permanent obstacle to that
“complete and intimate fusion” of the two
people, which was ultimately anticipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
by the Congress of Vienna. It was in order
to erect the new kingdom into a state of
adequate importance, that England, in addition
to concurring in the restoration of the
ancient Netherlands of Charles V, divested
herself of a portion of her colonial conquests
during the war to re-annex them to Holland,
thus feeding the national resources of
both sections of the new alliance—the Belgian
by an outlet for its manufactures, and the
Dutch by a carrying trade for their shipping.</p>

<p>The union, too, was a natural one, not
only geographically, but intrinsically. Belgium
had been compelled to become a
manufacturing country by the closing of
the Scheldt, at the treaty of Munster which
ended the Thirty years’ war in 1648, one
of those unnatural acts of state policy,
that seems almost an impious interference
with the benevolence of providence;
and which by annihilating this noble
river for all purposes of trade, had the
contemplated effect of driving commerce
to Amsterdam and Rotterdam, thus constraining
the Belgians to betake themselves
to industry and handicrafts at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
home. With such elasticity did they conform
to this necessity, that when the unnatural
embargo was taken off by the progress of
the French in 1794, the energies and genius
of the population had made such a decided
development, that they were not to be
seduced back into their old pursuits of
traffic, and the <i>manufactures</i> of Belgium continued
to prosper under “the continental
system” of Napoleon, down to the period
of the general peace. Holland, on the contrary,
with her hands fully employed by
her shipping and her trade, and possessing
no mines of iron or coal, had never either
the inducement or the temptation to become
a manufacturing country, so that nothing
could apparently be more happy, than the
union of one producing nation all alive
with machinery, with its neighbour proportionably
rich in shipping; and to open
to both an extensive colonial territory,
whose population the merchantmen of the
one could supply with the produce of the
other.</p>

<p>But even here lay the seeds of unforeseen
dissentions. Belgium, all whose notions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
commercial policy were formed upon the
false and narrow basis of France, was perpetually
calling for protective duties, bounties
and prohibitions, without which her
artisans were sinking under the effects of
foreign competition; whilst to the Dutch,
with their spirit of traffic and fleets of
shipping, every restriction upon absolute
free trade was a positive interception of
gain. This antagonism of interests led to
perpetual animosity in the states-general
upon all questions of customs and imposts,
and to such an extent did Holland give
way upon these points, in order to protect
the interests of Belgium at the sacrifice of
her own, that a well informed author observes
that, “<i>even supposing the desire for
separation had not arisen in Belgium, the
Dutch, ere long, would have been forced to
call for this divorce in order to save Amsterdam
and Rotterdam from ruin</i>.” It is more
likely, however, that the march of manufacturing
prosperity in Belgium, and the
increased demand and consumption of her
produce would have ultimately compensated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
her commercial colleague for all intermediate 
loss.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
But added to these pecuniary squabbles,
there were deeper and less tangible causes
of mutual repulsion, differences of language
and religion, and local prejudices and antipathies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
out of which speedily sprung an 
infinity of definite “grievances,” which
timely and conciliating interference and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
constitutional reforms might have allayed;
but which, there can be no doubt,
were obstinately and fatally neglected by
the King of Holland, and his irresponsible
ministers; and though it is absurd to regard
them, even if unredressed, as justifiable
grounds for revolution, they led ultimately
to the expulsion of the family of Nassau
from the Netherlands.</p>

<p>It seems to be admitted upon all hands,
that in this the King of Holland was seriously
to blame, and that whilst the political
causes of complaint were all capable
of easy removal or redress, they were overlooked
in his anxiety to stimulate and
promote the commercial prosperity of the
country. From the outset, he aimed
at eradicating the French institutions, to
which, during the twenty years of their
connexion with that country, the Belgians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
had become strongly attached, and to assimilate
them to the model of Holland.
His conduct, in this attempt, was strongly
contrasted with the prudence of the King
of Prussia, who having received his Transrhenan
provinces under precisely similar
circumstances, had never once attempted
to interfere with those habits and local
constitutions to which the people had
become familiarised. He even ventured to
remonstrate with the King of Holland on
the impolicy of his course, and to warn
him of the discontents it was likely to
engender, but received only a pettish reply
that, “his Majesty was old enough to act
for himself,”—a rebuff which the Prussian
monarch is said to have retorted when,
at a subsequent period, the King of Holland
applied to him for assistance to reconquer
Belgium, and he accompanied
his refusal with a remark, that he presumed
“his Majesty was old enough <i>to
fight</i> for himself.”</p>

<p>This unwise neglect of the political grievances
of Belgium, cannot be compensated
by the King’s exclusive devotion to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
manufacturing and substantial interests;
and even in this, it is doubtful whether his
zeal did not hurry him into an unwise extreme.
His great ambition was to render
his people “a nation of shopkeepers,” and
develop as thoroughly the manufacturing
resources of Belgium, as industry and care
had matured the agricultural and commercial
riches of Holland. There was no labour,
no expense, no care, no experiment
left unemployed to give life and impulse to
their grand object. One engrossing topic
was uppermost in his mind; which was not
inaptly compared to a “price current,” solely
influenced by the rise and fall of produce,
or the fluctuations of the funds. The
inventions of Watt and Fulton stood higher
in his estimation than the achievements of
Frederick or Napoleon. He protected the
arts, not so much from admiration as
policy, and he countenanced literature, not
from any devotion to letters, but because
it created a demand for articles of commerce.
In short, there was nothing classic,
inspiring or chivalrous in his bearing, all was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
material, positive and mathematical. Business
was his element, his recreation; and
amusement, but a robbery of that time
which he thought he ought to devote entirely
to his people. He loved to surround
himself with practical men, and he gained
the good will of all the great commercial
and financial aristocracy by the attention
he paid to them, individually and collectively.
It is incontestible, that if the happiness
and welfare of a nation had depended
on the laborious exertions and unremitting
devotion of the sovereign to commercial
affairs, then Belgium ought to have been as
contented as it was prosperous, and its
sovereign the most popular monarch in
Europe.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Under the auspices of such a sovereign,
Belgium, during the fifteen years of its connexion
with Holland, attained a height of
prosperity which no human being presumes
to question. Agriculture, recovering from
the sad effects of war, and receiving an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
augmented impulse from the demand created
by the commerce of Holland, speedily attained
the highest possible point of prosperity—mines
were opened, coal, iron and
all other, mineral wealth extensively explored;
manufactures and machinery were
multiplied to an extent beyond belief, and
the trade of Antwerp even outstepped that
of Holland in exporting the produce of
Belgium. Roads, canals and means of
communication were constructed with surprising
rapidity; sound and practical education
was universally diffused, in short,
every element of material prosperity became
fully developed, and what rendered the
progress of the nation the more important,
was the fact that it was not intermittent
or capricious, but exhibited one steady
march in its ascent in each successive year,
from the period of the union to the hour
of its disruption.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span></p>

<p>In such a combination of circumstances,
one is impatient to discover the specific
causes of discontent which could inflame
an entire population into all the fury of
revolt, and to the expulsion by blood and
the sword of a King, under whose sway
they acknowledge themselves to be debtors
for so many blessings. This is not the
place to canvas their merits, but in merely
enumerating the principal grievances of
which they complain, the “<i>griefs Belges</i>,”
as they were specially headed in the newspapers
of the time, it is impossible to avoid
being struck with the identity between the
vast majority of the pretexts for revolt propounded
by the “patrioterie” who Repealed
the Union in Belgium, and the “patriots”
who clamour for “the Repeal of the Union”
in Ireland. Nor did this similarity escape
the promoters of the revolution in either
country. In Ireland, it has been ostentatiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
and perseveringly dwelt upon, and 
even down to the present hour, the example
of the Belgians is paraded as an incentive
to the ambition of the enemies of British
connexion; and in Belgium, even before
the revolution, the position of the two
countries, as regarded their several legislative
connexions with England and Holland,
was the subject of repeated comparisons and
condolence. The “Belge,” a journal which
was active in the encouragement of the
movement, thus alludes to the coincidence
of their circumstances in 1830. “Belgium
has been long the Ireland of Holland, the
relation of the dominant power has been
in almost every particular, that of “<i>the
Sister Island</i>” to England—with the intolerable
addition, however, that while Ireland
has had the less population by far, Belgium
had by far the greater—that Belgium paid
much more than her proportion of the
taxes, whilst Ireland paid much less—that
Ireland often sent her inhabitants to share
in the distribution of places, pensions and
honours, whilst such a distribution amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
the Belgians was of extremely rare occurrence.”</p>

<p>But the similarity consists not less in
the ostensible grounds for revolt, than in
the identity of the actual instruments and
agents. In Belgium, as in Ireland, they
were the uneducated and bigotted mob,
inflamed by the half-educated press, and
led on by a propaganda of priests and a
crowd of unsuccessful and hungry lawyers.
In both countries, too, the leaders of the
movement, whatever may have been their
real and secret sentiments, ostensibly professed
to seek merely a redress of grievances,
and to start with alarm at the idea
of <i>separation</i>; their only desire being a <i>federative
union</i> under the same crown, but
with a distinct administration. The Belgian,
however, soon felt that he wanted
a power, which there is but little reason
to ascribe to the Irishman of saying “thus
far shalt thou go, and no farther,” and the
stimulants applied to the versatile vanity of
the people, soon rendered them impatient
of any proposition short of actual independence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
An unfortunate phrase in the treaty 
of Paris that Belgium was to be to Holland
“as an accession of territory,” was construed
into a national indignity, notwithstanding
the expression of perfect equality
and “fusion” which pervaded every other
passage of the document, and the cry of
“<i>a nation no longer a province</i>” became
forthwith the aspiration of every discontented
coterie. That distinction they have,
at length, attained, and enjoy the barren
eminence of a throne, but unfortunately
without either the power, the wealth, or
the influence as an European state, that
are essential to give it dignity and stability.</p>

<p>There are, however, some points of marked
distinction between the two cases, inasmuch
as whilst the Irish sufferers clamour
<i>for</i> assimilation to England, those in Belgium
flew to arms <i>against</i> assimilation with
Holland; and, besides the Belgian repealer
pursued his object of separation notwithstanding
the admitted prosperity of his
country, whilst the Irish one, less barefaced,
tries eagerly to invent a case of distress in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
order to justify his treason. Above all,
there is this happy difference, that whilst
in Belgium the repeal has been achieved
at the expense of national prosperity, Ireland
has still the opportunity to reflect and
to be warned by her lamentable example.</p>

<p>The civil grievances of the revolutionists
arose out of certain measures of the King,
in some of which he was manifestly wrong;
his attempts to render Dutch the national
language for all public documents in certain
provinces—to abolish trial by jury, which
had been established by the French—to
remove the supreme court of judicature to
the Hague—and to introduce the principles
of Dutch law into all their pleas and proceedings.
The two latter were the usual vexatious
manifestations of the spirit of centralization,
which a prudent government would
never have attempted to force upon the
unwilling prejudices of a nation; and the
substitution of the Dutch tribunal for the
trial by jury would have been a substantial
injustice, had the people been unanimous,
or even, in a considerable proportion, favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
to it; but in the divisions upon 
the question in the States General, large
bodies of the Belgian representatives were
found voting constantly against it; and
<i>even now, notwithstanding its re-establishment,
it has become more and more unpopular,
and even those who supported it in 1830,
refuse to sit upon juries themselves, or to
uphold the system by their co-operation</i>. The
alteration of the language was an unwise
attempt to force upon four millions of Belgians
the dialect of three millions of Dutch.
This has, however, been sought to be defended
by stating, that of the entire population
of the united kingdom, one fifth
alone spoke French, namely in Hainault,
the Waloons, South Brabant, and a part of
Luxembourg; and the remainder dialects of
German, in the proportion of two fifths
Dutch, and two fifths Flemish. The imposing
Dutch upon the entire was not,
therefore, more unjust than would have
been a similar imposition of Flemish, <i>and
yet, within this very year, the party who reviled
the one to the death in 1830, have begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
to petition the legislature for the other</i>! They
are contented now to abandon French,
which they then contended for, and to
accept the barbarous patois of Flanders as
its substitute, which would be equally unintelligible
to the Waloons, and even in those
districts of Antwerp which border upon
Holland.</p>

<p>Another complaint had reference to the
disproportionate distribution of government
patronage between the subjects of Holland
and Belgium, in which there may have been
much truth, and to which the government
did not take the most wise nor the most
soothing steps to reconcile the minority, by
ascribing it to the <i>dearth of talent</i> amongst
their countrymen. <i>Like the Irish</i>, the Belgian
agitators protested against the taxes of
Belgium being made applicable to the discharge
of the national debt, of which the
largest proportion had been contracted by
Holland before the period of the union—but
having by the Revolution secured the
management of the national revenues in
their own hands, <i>an evil of more serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
magnitude has been discovered, in the fact,
that the expenditure of Belgium in every year
since the Revolution, with the single exception
of 1835, has exceeded the revenue by some
millions of francs</i>. In 1831 and 1832 this
was strikingly the case, the expenses of
the war and of new establishments leading
in the former year to an expenditure of
upwards of four millions, and in the latter
to eight millions sterling. In</p>

<p>The interest upon the national debt of
the independent state exceeds at the present
moment £800,000 a year. Besides, during
the Dutch regime, it appeared that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
Belgium, <i>as in Ireland</i>, the malcontents
bore the most trifling proportion of the national
burthens, the revenue of the three
years preceding the revolt being paid in
the proportion of sixteen florins per head
for every inhabitant of Holland, and only
ten for those of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Another grievance, no less <i>Irish</i> than
Belgian, was that the number of representatives
was not regulated exclusively in
proportion to the <i>population</i> of the two
states, totally irrespective of the relative
territory and possessions of each—and
although the representation was exactly
divided, one half of the States General being
Dutch and one half Belgian, a division
warranted by the large territorial interests
of the former; the patriots and their disturbers
complained “<i>Si l’on nous avait attribué
une représentation en rapport avec la population</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">NOUS AURIONS DOMINÉ LE NORD</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
The frankness of this avowal has not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
been imitated by the Repealers of Ireland;
but its aspiration is not the less manifest
in the similarity of their pretensions; and
the frequent references of the Irish agitator
in the House of Commons to the relative
population and comparative electoral constituencies
of the counties of England and
Ireland, irrespective of their relative wealth
and property, parrotted as they have recently
been by members of her Majesty’s
government, may no doubt be construed
into an ill-concealed adoption of the sentiments
of the repealers of Belgium.</p>

<p>These, and a few other minor points, were
the burthen of all the <i>civil</i> grievances against
which the oppressed patriots of Belgium
had to protest; and it is not difficult to perceive
that it required but a little complaisance
on the part of the Dutch government
to redress them, although it is too late to
regret that that redress was not timely
applied. It is impossible, however, for
any sober minded citizen to discern in the
entire mass of these complaints, even in
all their aggravation, any adequate ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
for a resort to the last remedy of oppression—war,
and revolution; and in vain
would the restless promoters of the revolt
have laboured to inflame the populace by
rhapsodies on the glory of independence,
or diatribes against the pronunciation of
Dutch,—in vain would they have attempted
to sting them into madness by calculations
of finance, or lamentations over the exclusion
of some provincial orator, from a seat
in the legislature or a portfolio in some
public bureau,—all these whips and stimulants
would have been powerless and
unfelt, had not <i>religion</i> been introduced in
association with each, and the ascendancy
of the Roman Catholic church been made
the alpha and the omega—the beginning
and the end—the burthen of every complaint,
and the object of every exhortation.</p>

<p>The avowed cause of the dissatisfaction
of the clergy, was that the King <i>was a protestant</i>,
and that protection and full toleration
was extended to all sects and religious
communities. The genius and pretensions
of the Roman Catholic church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
seems, down to the present hour, to have
undergone less modification in Belgium
than in any other country of Europe, with
the single exception, perhaps, of Rome
itself. It was to preserve it in all its integrity
that Philip II. and the Duke of Alva
for thirty years exhausted the blood and
treasure of Spain in its defence, and down
to the present hour, its clergy exhibit a
practical gratitude for their devotion, by the
uncompromising assertion of every attribute
for which they contended. Belgium is,
at this moment, the most thoroughly catholic
country in Europe, and the recent exploits
of the Archbishop of Cologne attest
the power of its example and its influence
even over the adjoining states.</p>

<p>Under the dominion of Austria, the
authority of the church had been recognized
by the crown, in all its plenitude and
power, and the subsequent union of Belgium
to France in 1795, was eagerly resisted
by the clergy, who naturally saw in
it the subversion of their power before that
of the Goddess of Reason. But even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
influence of twenty years of intimate association
with France, proved incapable to
diminish the ardent subjection of the Belgians
to their priesthood, or temper the
ambition of their prelates and their clergy;
and when, at length, the clasps which held
together the empire of Napoleon, flew
asunder in 1814, the utmost desire of the
priesthood was to have Belgium again
restored to her ancient masters, and <i>re-constructed
as a province of Austria</i>, in which
event, they calculated that the elevation
of the church would follow, as of course.
This, however, European policy forbade;
and when, in 1814, the prelates of Flanders
found themselves abandoned by their
chosen sovereign, who accepted, in exchange,
the more attractive provinces of Italy,
and handed them over to one of the most
Protestant monarchs in Europe, their consternation
was unbounded, and in the extravagance
of their disappointment, they had the
madness to address a memorial to the Congress
of Vienna, which is well worthy of
being preserved as an authentic manifesto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
of the pretensions of the Roman Catholic
church in modern times.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>It bears date in October, 1814, and is
signed by the vicars-general of the Prince
de Broglie, who was then Bishop of Ghent.
It sets out by an exposition of a principle
learned, they say, from experience, that it is
indispensable for a catholic country passing
under the government of a protestant sovereign,
to stipulate for the free exercise of its
own worship, and for placing all its ancient
rights and privileges beyond the reach of any
interference of the state (“<i>hors de toute atteinte
de la part du Souverain</i>”). The religion
of Luther, the vicars-general proceeded to
remind the Congress, is merely <i>tolerated</i> in
Germany beside that of Rome, although it is
very absurd to approve of two doctrines that
contradict each other; but in Belgium, the
latter has been distinctly recognized from
immemorial time, and they, therefore, feel
it is incumbent on them early to demand a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
formal guarantee for its exclusive exercise,
“<i>l’exercice exclusif</i>,” which had been secured
to them, at former times, by the most
solemn treaties. They warn the Prince of
Orange, that he will find it his future interest,
as well as that of Europe in general,
whose object it must be to have Belgium
peaceful and contented, to enter into an
inaugural compact with the church, regarding
the maintenance of all its ancient authority,
and candidly intimate that the
result shall never be satisfactory, if their
own demands are not complied with in the
following particulars:—First, the exclusive
establishment of the Roman Catholic religion,
<i>with this exception, that the royal family and
the court may have a place of protestant worship
in their palaces or chateaus, but that on
no pretence whatever, is a protestant church to
be erected elsewhere</i>. The words of this
postulate are as distinct as their import is
remarkable in the nineteenth <span class="err" title="original: centurry">century</span>:—“Avec
cette exception, que le Prince Souverain
et son auguste famille seront libres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
de professer leur religion, et d’en exercer
le culte dans leurs palais, chateaux, et maisons
royales, ou les seigneurs de sa cour
auront des chapelles et des ministres de
leur religion, <i>sans qu’il soit permis d’ériger
des temples hors de l’enceinte de ces palais,
sous quelque pretexte que ce soit</i>.” Secondly,
that the church was to have absolute dominion
in all matters concerning its own
affairs. Thirdly, that the Council of State
was to be composed <i>exclusively of Roman
Catholics</i>, including <i>two bishops</i> of the establishment.
Fourthly and fifthly, that a
nuncio should be received from the Roman
See, to treat with the council, and a new
concordat obtained with the Pope. Sixthly,
<i>that it was indispensably essential, in order to
provide a perpetual maintenance for the clergy
beyond all control of the state, that tithes
should be re-established throughout Belgium</i>;
the protestants, of course, contributing to
the maintenance of the church from which
they dissented! Seventhly, the re-establishment
of the university of Louvain;
and lastly, the restoration of the <i>monks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
religious orders</i> which had been suppressed
by the Emperor Joseph II, and “<i>as one of
the most excellent means, and, perhaps, the
only one, at the present day, to secure to
youth the blessings of an education combining,
at once, the principles of genuine religion and
the acquirements of human learning, the re-establishment
of the Jesuits throughout Belgium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>”</p>

<p>Whether this extraordinary document
was really framed with a view to influence
the deliberations of the Congress, or written
with a full anticipation of their ultimate
conclusion, and designed only as a
defiance and a bold forewarning of the consequence,
it had but little weight at Vienna,
and the provinces were consigned, without
the required stipulations, to the King of
Holland.</p>

<p>The constitution of the new state was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
based upon principles of the most unrestricted
toleration and protection for all
denominations of religion. But toleration
and freedom of opinion are the very essence
of the reformation, and the Roman
Catholic clergy had the discernment to perceive
that no more effectual system could
have been established for the silent but
ultimate subversion of their church, than
by reducing it to an equality with every
other, thus lending the authority of the
state in ascribing to many the possession
of that saving faith, which it is fatal to the
very spirit of catholicism to have attributed
to any but one—and that one, herself.
Equal rights and protection were to her
more pernicious than proscription and persecution,
and no other course was left to
her than that precisely which she adopted
to protest against toleration in the first
instance, and to revolt against it in the
end.</p>

<p>By an arrangement of the new government,
no public functionary or officer connected
with any department of the state,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
was to enter upon his functions before
having taken an oath to maintain all the
principles and observe all the enactments
of the Constitution. But as amongst these
were comprised the fundamental law of
“toleration,” another manifesto was instantly
issued by the prelates, prohibiting all Roman
Catholics from subscribing to the obnoxious
oath, as subversive of all the principles
of the church of Rome, and ruinous
to her attributes and claims!</p>

<p>The articles which they objected to were
those which guaranteed to all religious
denominations of Christians perfect liberty
of conscience, freedom of worship, an
equality of civil rights and indiscriminate
eligibility to all public employments.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> To
swear to the observance of such a law, the
prelates declared to be neither more nor
less than to exact equal protection for error
as for truth,—and to countenance the admission
to places of honour and trust, without
distinction of religion, was merely sanctioning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
by anticipation, measures that might 
hereafter be taken for permitting the interference
of protestants in the affairs of the
catholic community. The words of the
Constitution established the unlimited exercise
of public worship, “unless where it
gave rise to any public disturbance,” <i>lorsqu’il
a été l’occasion d’un trouble</i>; “but the
bishops protested, that to give a power to
the government to interfere under any limitation,
was to submit the church to the
authority of its enemies; and that <i>to
swear obedience to any constitution which presumed
the Catholic Church to be subject to the
temporal law was manifestly to subscribe to its
humiliation</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> “To ascribe,” they said,
“to a sovereign of a different faith, <i>a right
of interference in the regulation of national
education</i> would be to hand over public
instruction to the secular power, and would
exhibit a shameful betrayal of the dearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
interests of the church. There are other
articles of the Constitution,” continues the
manifesto, “which no true child of the
Catholic Church can ever undertake, by a
solemn oath, to observe or to support, and
<i>above all others that which establishes</i> <span class="allsmcap">THE
LIBERTY OF THE PRESS</span>!”</p>

<p>This singular document bore the signatures
of the Prince Maurice de Broglie,
Bishop of Ghent, Charles Francis Joseph
Pisani de la Gaude, Bishop of Namur,
François Joseph, Bishop of Tournai, and of
J. Forgeur and J. A. Barrett, the Vicars-General
of Malines and Liege. I have preserved
it and the memorial to the Congress
of Vienna, as the most remarkable denunciations
against liberty of conscience that
modern times have produced, and a singular
evidence of how little influence the example,
or the intimate association of twenty
years with the liberalism of France, was
capable of producing on the spirit and
genius of the church of Rome.</p>

<p>Its promulgation produced an instant
effect upon the weak consciences of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
people, which, for a time, was productive
of the utmost embarrassment to the establishment
and arrangements of the new
government, as individuals were prevented
from accepting offices, which were open to
them, from a dread of the vengeance of the
altar. Its mischievous consequences were,
however, after a time, defeated by the temperate
conduct of the Prince de Mean, the
last Prince Bishop of Liege, and subsequently
Bishop of Malines, who had not
signed the document, and who took the
requisite oath, <i>subject to approval of the
Pope</i>, an example which was speedily followed
by all whom the incentive of office
inspired with a natural anxiety to avail
themselves of so high an authority.</p>

<p>The King now administered the law with
an apparent oblivion of every previous act
of the Roman Catholic clergy. The income
which was appropriated by the state for
their support, was <i>augmented</i> at his suggestion,
the remotest interference with their
worship was in no solitary instance attempted,
and churches were built for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
accommodation in the poorer districts, to
which his Majesty himself was a liberal
contributor. For some years every pretext
for special complaint was successfully
avoided, and the country was too rapidly
prosperous to be yet ripe for any efforts to
excite abstract discontent. But, at length,
about 1825, the striking results of the
Dutch system of National Education, to
which I have referred in a former chapter,
were so apparent, that the spread of
intelligence and instruction became too
alarming to permit the church to be longer
quiescent, and resistance was at once commenced,
notwithstanding the fact, that the
religious education in the primary schools
was scrupulously reserved for the superintendence
of the priests, and theology was
utterly excluded from the courses of the
universities, and handed over exclusively to
the college of Louvain. But education,
even under these limitations, must be instantly
suppressed, or unreservedly submitted
to the church, without any control
from the ministry of the interior. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
concessions upon this point served only to
give confidence to the boldness of further
demands, and when these were resisted,
every other grievance, civil and religious,
having in the mean time undergone the
necessary process of aggravation and
distortion to ripen the passions of the
“patrioterie” for revolt, the mine was considered
ready for explosion, “and the whole
country,” to use the words of Baron
Keverberg,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> “resounded with the cry of
the priests, who filled Europe with their
denunciations of resentment. To listen to
them, one would imagine that the Catholic
Church in the Netherlands groaned in the
chains of an unrelenting oppression, and
that the King had sworn to tear the faith
of their fathers from the hearts of his subjects,
and to hesitate at no measure, however
furious or tyrannical, to “protestantize
their country.” It is unnecessary to say that
these were not only pure fabrications,
“mere rhetorical artifices,” to serve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
purpose of the hour, since even their
authors now admit this to be the fact.
In a recent publication of the journal of
Bruges, which is devoted to the <i>liberal</i>
party, it avows that William I. so far from
being the “protestant tyrant which it was
then expedient to represent him, was the
most tolerant of princes, ‘le plus tolerant
que l’on puisse s’imaginer,’ and only hated
by the priesthood because he would not
endure them to <i>place the altar upon the
throne itself</i>, as they have succeeded in
doing by the revolution of 1830.”</p>

<p>With this imperfect <i>aperçu</i> of the origin
of the Belgian revolution, it is easy to
collect its objects, its agents, and its effects.
The union of the Liberals, with the priesthood
and their followers, who formed the
preponderating mass of the population,
formed an alliance so powerful, that the
whole strength of Holland was unequal to
withstand it, much less the small body of
reflecting and loyal subjects, who still remained
faithful to the union and the crown,
and who were not only overwhelmed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
violence of the commotion at the moment,
but so utterly discomfited by its ultimate
consequences, that they have never since
been able to rally as a party. But the
immediate object being once achieved, the
union of the “<i>clerico-liberal</i>” confederacy
did not long survive its consummation.
The “compact alliance” between the priests
and the liberals had been sought by the
former only to effect a definite purpose,
which could not otherwise be attained, <i>the
Repeal of the Union</i>; and no sooner was this
accomplished, than the intolerant ambition
of the clergy, put an end to all further co-operation
between them. The party of the
priests had then become all powerful by
their numbers, and no longer requiring
the assistance of their former allies, they
boldly attempted their own objects independently,
and in defiance of them. It is
rather a ludicrous illustration of their zeal
and its aim, that among the crowd of
aspirants who were named for the crown of
Belgium in 1831, the <i>Pope</i> himself was put
in nomination! and had the decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
remained with the revolutionists, there can
be no doubt that the Netherlands would
have been added to the territory of the Holy
See.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Before twelve months from the expulsion
of the King of Holland, the body by
whom it was effected was split into two
contending factions, and, at the present
hour, the two opposing parties who contest
every measure in the legislation of Belgium,
are the quondam allies of the revolution,—the
Liberals, and the “<i>parti prêtre</i>,” the
latter of whom have the decided majority,
and rule their former associates with a rod
of iron.</p>

<p>Every thing, in fact, is regulated by the
wishes of that numerous body of the priesthood,
who from their ardent exertions for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
ascendancy, have obtained the title of the
<i>La Mennaisiens</i>, and whose influence in
every family and in every parish, rules,
regulates and determines every political
movement. They it is who conduct all
the elections, name the candidates, and
marshal the constituency to the poll, and
when I was at Ghent, the curate of Bottelaer,
a rural district in the vicinity, read
from the altar the persons for whom the
congregation were to vote, at a pending
contest, on pain of the displeasure of the
Bishop. If the coincidence does not strike
irresistibly every individual, who has
attended to what is passing in Belgium, it
is here again unnecessary to point out the
parallel, between the composition of the
two parties, in that country and Ireland,
who sympathise in the principle of repeal
and separation. In each country the majority
of the “movement” is composed of the
Roman Catholic clergy, and the devotees
of the church, but in both their strength
would be ineffectual, and certainly their
object suspected, had they not been joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
by honest but mistaken individuals, who,
aiming at Utopian theories in politics, have
been content to employ for their accomplishment,
the aid of those, whose designs
are more essentially sectarian, than civil or
political.</p>

<p>In Belgium, however, the demonstration
has been made, of what may be expected
to ensue, should the project of Repealing
the Union be ever successfully effected in
Ireland. There, as in Flanders and Brabant,
the priests and their followers would
have the overwhelming majority; and
caution or concealment being no longer
essential, the triumph of their attempt,
would be but the signal for discarding their
allies, and proceeding boldly to the consummation
of their own ambition. The union
once repealed, the objects of the liberal
protestants of Ireland and the Roman
Catholic party, would be as distinct as the
very spirit of freedom, and the genius of
despotism could render them. The manifesto
of the Roman Catholic prelates to
the Congress of Vienna, and their protest
against <i>Liberty of Conscience</i>, <i>Education</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
and <i>the Freedom of the Press</i> in Belgium,
made, not at any remote or antiquated era of
history, <i>but within the last ten years</i>, sufficiently
attest the animus in which their
admirers and imitators would set about the
regeneration of Ireland. The Archbishop
of Malines would find a cotemporary and
congenial spirit in the benignant prelate of
Tuam, the pastoral superintendance of the
clergy would be as vigorous in the elections
for a domestic, as for a “Saxon” legislature,
and as successful in securing a
majority in the parliament of Dublin, as in
the “Palace of the Nation,” and the services
of the patriots who now shout in the train
of the Agitator, could be as readily dispensed
with in Ireland, as they have
been summarily discarded in Belgium.</p>

<p>Were the union between the two countries
once repealed, the union between the
two sections, by whose co-operation direct
or indirect it had been effected, would not
survive it one single year—the influence of
the protestant and English party in Ireland,
would in such a conjuncture be as effectually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
annihilated, as had been the adherents 
of Holland, in Belgium; and the deluded
liberals, by whose unwise assistance they
had been overwhelmed, would find themselves
in the position of the moderate
section of the chambers of Brussels, the
<span class="err" title="original: consciencious">conscientious</span>, but inefficient opponents of
a despotism, more formidable than that
they had overthrown, inasmuch as the
tyranny of the million exceeds the tyranny
of the individual, and infinitely more
galling, inasmuch as they had themselves
contributed unwillingly to impose it upon
their country.</p>

<p>In such a state of things, it is easy to
imagine the discontent and disunion, which
pervades every department of Belgium; its
trade and manufactures, labouring under
wants and pressures, which the government
have not the power, however anxious their
inclination, to relieve; the civil grievances
for the abatement of which the revolution
was undertaken, only partially redressed,
and in some instances, exchanged for
others, the immediate offspring of the
remedy itself,—and to crown all, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
government and the country submitted to
a religious ascendancy, which is as unwisely
exercised by the party who have attained
to it, as it is suspected and disliked by
their opponents, who smart under its caprices
and suffer from its indiscretion.</p>

<p>Even the very last act of the revolution,
and that which might be regarded as placing
the seal to the European bond, for its permanency,
namely the ratification of the
final treaty for the partition with Holland
last year, seems to have only added to the
existing insecurity; the leaders of 1830,
loudly protesting against the assignment
to Holland of these portions of Luxembourg
and Limbourg, which have been decreed
to her, and the mercantile interests, uniting
in complaints, that the government of
King Leopold, have been outwitted by the
ministers of the Hague, and have not only
submitted to surrender 350,000 of their
already reduced population of consumers to
Holland, but have ceded to her demands,
which will inflict injury upon the navigation
of the Meuse and the Scheldt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>

<p>I can state from my own observation,
that I have not conversed on the subject
with a single individual in Belgium, who
expressed himself thoroughly satisfied with
the present posture of affairs. On the contrary,
I have found every where irritated
dissatisfaction, and if not open regret for
the events of 1830, and distinct wishes for
a reunion with Holland, the utmost perplexity
to discover some yet untried expedient,
which would hold out a hope of
restoring the country to its tranquil prosperity,
whether as an independent nation,
or in incorporation with some other state.
<i>On all hands, it seemed to be felt that for
things to go on as at present is impossible</i>,
this was the constant theme of conversation
in society, and the pamphlets and brochures
which I picked up in the shops, are filled
with discussions of the same subject, but
in terms much more acrimonious and exciting.</p>

<p>One of these, which I found selling at
Ghent, entitled “<i>La Belgique de Leopold,
par un voyageur Français</i>,” and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
though strongly in favour of Holland, is
evidently written by a person well informed
on the state of Belgium, thus speaks of the
present state of feeling in that country;
and the publicity with which pamphlets of
this kind are exposed for sale, and their circulation
are evidences of an extensive
sympathy with the author’s views.
“The Belgians,” the author says, “of
all classes, representatives and constituencies,
rich and poor, long for the
arrival of the moment, which is to disembarrass
them from an imaginary nationality,
a delusive freedom and an independence,
whose very name has become a jest—but
they want as yet the energy which is
essential to hasten their relief. It is possible,
that in the little circle, whose life and
fortunes are dependent upon Leopold, there
may be some who flatter themselves with
the hope that the ratification of the treaty
of 1839, is the consolidation and establishment
of his power * * But the vast
body of the nation less involved in the
immediate question of the revolution, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
far from regarding the present peaceful
position as one of long duration, although
guaranteed to the new state in the name of
the same powerful courts, which by treaties
not less solemn and sage had conferred the
crown upon the former dynasty from whose
brows, it had been rudely torn by the revolution
* * * At this moment, the
prolonged existence of Belgium, as an independent
state, is a matter of impossibility,
its manufactures, its commerce and its prosperity
are annihilated, and it is crushed to
the earth under the pressure of its debt and
taxes. Without ships, colonies or commerce,
and encumbered by an army, which
never fights, and fortresses destined for
demolition, it is merely the jibe and the
laughing stock of Europe * * * The
very authors of the revolt of 1830, blush
for their own handiwork, and those who
were then the most zealous apostles of
revolution, now preach only contrition and
repentance. The defection is universal—and
above all the army,—the army, exposed
every day to the most cutting sarcasms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
vents its indignation in menaces and murmurs.
Every class of the population, including
those who would have been perfectly
contented with the present order of
things, were the circumstances of the country
at all tolerable; the whole nation, in
short, except the fraction of a fraction,
without numbers, wealth nor weight, unite
in aspiration for the return of the House of
Orange; and the restoration of the kingdom
of 1815, is in every heart and on every
tongue * * Belgium, has herself, no
other alternative left to her, and if from
predilection and choice she does not invoke
the return of a race of princes enlightened,
paternal, courageous and brave, she must
speedily be reduced by famine, to implore
the restoration, as her only relief from evils
of the last extremity. Their restoration
may be regarded, at this moment, as morally
accomplished, the universal voice of the
nation has decreed it, and it requires but
an accident, an excuse, a name, a banner,
and the existence of the revolutionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
kingdom is terminated without another
‘protocol.’”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the position
of King Leopold must be any thing but an
easy one, if his ambition extends to the
foundation of a royal dynasty for his descendants.
The religious grievances of the
nation are, it is too much to be feared, beyond
his reach to correct, and the evils which
beset and endanger its internal prosperity,
arising out of the circumscribed resources of
the nation, must look in vain to them for
redress. The fundamental defect is the
want of an adequate consumption for the
produce of the national industry, and for
this the ingenuity of the government has
been ineffectually tortured to discover a
remedy. It is idle to look to Germany or
England for <i>commercial treaties</i> which would
afford an opening for Belgian manufactures
in competition with their own; important
concessions have been made to France, by
the reduction of duties upon her produce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
when imported into Belgium, but no reciprocal
advantages have been obtained in
return; on the contrary, ever since 1815,
when the Netherlands were taken from her,
to be given to Holland, she has exhibited
a waspish impatience to embarrass and
undermine her prosperity. <i>Prospects of
colonization</i> have been discussed and even
proposals made to other states for permission
to attempt settlements on their distant
territory—and where these have failed,
commercial expeditions have been dispatched
to Algiers, to Egypt, to Brasil,
to Bolivia and Peru, all with a view to
open a trading intercourse with the natives,
but each and all have proved hopelessly
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of Ghent and Verviers,
have thus turned their eyes towards
the Zoll-Verein, and year after year attempts
have been made to effect a connexion,
if not a formal juncture with the
Prussian Commercial League; but here
again disappointment alone awaited them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
for independently of the fact, that by the
constitution of the Zoll-Verein, it is accessible
only to those of German blood (on
which score Luxembourg might have been
admissible), it was manifestly hostile to
the very spirit of the league, whose object
is to protect their own native manufacturers,
to admit amongst them a formidable rival,
who would inundate them with her produce,
and could take nothing from them in
return.</p>

<p>But if the necessities and weakness of
Belgium, render it impracticable for her to
continue as she is, and if national independence
be irreconcilable with her prosperity,
the question which occupies the thoughts
of her discontented subjects, is to what
quarter she shall turn for relief from without.
To attach herself again to Austria,
as before the French revolution, is a matter
impracticable and could be productive of no
advantage, even if it were otherwise. The
condition of the Rhenish provinces, under
the dominion of Prussia, would make her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
eager for a similar incorporation, but this
the interests of Europe, as well as those of
Prussia herself forbid.</p>

<p>An union with France would be equally
hopeless and incompatible with the policy
of the Congress of Vienna, and would, with
the exception of the districts immediately
bordering on the French frontier, be in the
highest degree distasteful to the population
at large. Their annexation to the territory
of France in 1794, had been resisted by
the clergy, and its termination in 1814
was hailed with rapturous impatience by all
classes. Their condition under the empire
had been one “of the most insignificant
vassalage. Their religious institutions destroyed,
their cherished privileges annihilated,
and all their rights and immunities
for which they had been contending for
centuries before, trodden under foot.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Even their commerce and manufactures
were <span class="err" title="jeopardied">jeopardised</span> by the jealous rivalry of
their new allies, their clergy debased, and
their youth drafted off by conscription to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
feed the slaughter of Europe. The recollection
of this has left no vigorous desire for
a return to fraternization with France, nor
would France herself, however important
Belgium might be as a political acquisition,
consult the interest of her native manufactures
by imparting an equality in all her
advantages to competitors so formidable.
Still so impatient are the Belgians to fly
from the “ills they have,” that at the
present moment, whilst the possibility of
war between France and the rest of Europe
occupies the attention of all the world,
I was repeatedly assured in Belgium
that it would only require France to
give the signal, and a powerful section
of the people would declare in her
favour. So conscious are all parties of
this, that the bare probability of war in
Europe is looked to with the utmost alarm
by the government, and the <i>Controleur</i>, an
appropriately named journal, the organ of
the clerical party, was anxiously busied,
whilst I was in Ghent, in decrying any idea
of a re-union with France, declaring in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
of its publications early in September:
“Et comme nous n’avons pas pour habitude
de cacher notre manière de voir, nous
dirons rondement, <i>que nous serions plutôt
Hollandais que Français</i>.—En dépit de M.
Rogier.”</p>

<p>Another suggestion has been the <i>partition</i>
of Belgium between the surrounding
states, but to this equally insurmountable
obstacles present themselves. Antwerp
and the districts on the Dutch frontier, if
assigned to Holland, would have no longer
employment for their capital and ships, and
would again sink under the more favoured
rivalry of Amsterdam and Rotterdam; and as
Hainault and the fortresses along the Meuse
and the Sambre would necessarily fall to
the lot of France, a measure so menacing
to the future security of Europe, would not
be tolerated by her courts, unless these
strongholds were garrisoned by the allies,
an expedient which would be equally opposed
by the pride and ambition of the
French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span></p>

<p>If the further experience should unfortunately
decide finally against the permanence
of Belgium as an independent nation,
the only practical expedient which remains,
and that which has already received the
sanction of all the great powers of Europe,
would be a return to the disposition made
by the Congress of Vienna, and the reincorporation
of Holland and Belgium, to
form again the united kingdom of the
Netherlands. Personal aversion to King
William would no longer oppose a barrier
to such an arrangement, as his dominion has
passed into other hands, and the Prince of
Orange, the present king at all times enjoyed
the popular affections, if not the national confidence
of the people. Should any fresh convulsion
arise, which for the sake of the peace
of Europe, not less than for that of King
Leopold, it is most earnestly to be hoped
may be yet averted, all I have either seen
or been able to learn from those best informed
upon the matter, leaves little doubt
in my mind, that the almost unanimous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
wish of the people, should they be compelled
to change their present dynasty,
would point to the restoration of the House
of Nassau.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> By the French commercial code, there are three descriptions
of trading companies. First, <i>sociétés en nom collectif</i>,
with all the attributes of an ordinary partnership in England;
secondly, <i>sociétés en commandite</i>, where the great majority of
the associated capitalists are sleeping partners, with no
share in the management, no name in the firm, and responsible
only to the extent of their registered capital, one or more
of the partners, alone, having the conduct of the establishment,
and being responsible to the public to the full extent
of their property; and thirdly, the <i>sociétés anonymes</i>, which
are, in every incident and particular analogous to the joint
stock companies of England, only with a liability, limited in
every instance to the amount of their shares.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> These engines are in great esteem, and I have found
them in almost universal use in Belgium. The one alluded
to above, was consuming from 5½ of to 6½ lbs. of coals, per hour,
per horse power; whilst a low pressure engine in England,
would require from 12 to 14lbs. In this country, they are
likewise coming in greater demand, although here the
saving of coal is a matter of less importance, and may be,
in some degree, counterbalanced by the risk, and more
frequent repairs, incidental to high pressure engines.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> The price of coal at Ghent, when I visited its manufactories
was 20 francs for 1000 kilogrammes, or about
sixteen shillings a ton for coals of Mons, which are brought
from a considerable distance by the Scheldt; those of
Charleroi are of better quality, and a shade higher in price.
Coals have increased in price in Belgium within the last
few years, as well from the greater demand, as an apprehension
that the coal fields of the Ardennes were rapidly exhausting,
but this alarm has of late been regarded as
groundless. England, with a liberality, which manufactoring
jealousy scarcely sanctions, has recently permitted the free
export of coal both to Belgium, France and Prussia, a boon
for which these governments, which are prohibiting British
manufactures, and their mechanics and mill owners, who
are contending with our own for the market, cannot be too
grateful.</p>

<p>These wages, <i>at present</i>, paying in Ghent, it must be borne
in mind, are hardly a fair criterion, as flax spinning being
entirely a new trade there, it was necessary to give an
inducement by extra wages, for the cotton spinner’s to leave
the work to which they were accustomed; but this will soon
find its level.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> It is curious that this process which all concur in
representing to be one requiring the utmost cleanliness
and purity, should of all places be performed in Holland
with an utter neglect of both. In an able document by
Mr. Acton, in the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture for 1832,
he gives the following account of the operation. “The mode
of watering flax in Holland, and in the low lands of Belgium
and France, is to put a dam across the canal, clean
out the weeds and mud for a few yards next the dam, lay
in three or four rows of sheaves of flax next the dam, and
then covering these six inches deep with the rank herbage
that grows in the canal, and the mud raked up from its
bottom. A few more courses of sheaves are next placed in
the same way as the first, and covered in the same way with
weeds and mud, till the whole is put in steep. These fosses,
and the mode of placing the flax in them, are as they ought
to be, but the propriety of dragging up so much mud or
slime from the bottom of the canals, to cover the sheaves,
six inches deep, may well be doubted, it cannot fail to
besmear the lint so much, as to render it so nasty, that it
would require to be much rinsed and washed in the water
to remove the mud. This not only creates labour, by no
means the most agreeable, but must greatly injure the flax
by ruffling it in the water, a thing that ought to be avoided.”—Vol.
iv. p. 174.</p>

Flanders; in order to confine it to whom it has been written

translated into French, for which I am indebted to a particular
source, I have placed in the appendix to these volumes.
Knowing it as I do, to be the genuine and anxious suggestions

as a faithful guide to their process, and would be
well deserving of extensive circulation in the flax districts

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> On the first out-break of the revolution, the people of
Antwerp, strongly opposed to it, sent the following address
to the King of Holland. “Sire, it is not without painful
sensations that we have been apprised of the demand made
to your Majesty, tending to obtain a separation of interests
between the southern and northern provinces. The fear
that our silence may be interpreted as an adhesion to this
proposition, imposes upon us the duty of exposing to your
Majesty, that the wish is in no way participated in by us.
The experience of fifteen years has proved to us, in the most
evident manner, that is to the free and mutual exchange of
produce, that we are indebted for reciprocal prosperity. <i>The
advantages that navigation derives from the colonies, the increasing
outlets that these same colonies constantly offer to the
produce of our industry, are irrefragible proofs, that any separation
would not only be fatal to this province, but to the commercial
industry of all Belgium.</i> Intimately persuaded of this
great truth, we dare to make it known to your Majesty, with
that confidence and respect inspired by a King, who desires
the welfare of his people, and who will never labour but in
the interest of its well understood prosperity.”—<i>Antwerp,
September</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1830.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> The Belgian manufacturers themselves were, as I have
before stated, perfectly alive to the mischief which the separation
from Holland was certain to entail upon them; and
it is curious, as well as interesting, to remark the circumstantial
fidelity with which these protectors warned the
movement party of the consequences which they were provoking,
and which have since been accomplished to the letter.
The following reasons against separation from Holland were
published at the time in one of the journals of Antwerp, when
the prospect of Repealing the Union was most unpalatable:</p>

<p>“Ever since some parts of our southern provinces have
unfurled the banner of insurrection, all business has ceased.
Circulation has been interrupted, and several establishments,
which required the employment of great capital and
afforded the means of subsistance to numerous families,
have been destroyed and burned. Public tranquillity disturbed
in every manner; men, the most peaceable, and a
short time ago happy in the bosom of their families, prospering
under the protection of order and the laws, now
forcibly torn from their homes to perform military service
of which they are ignorant, and which they dislike; their
property every day exposed and ready to become the prey
of an unbridled populace—a state of anarchy which will
end by creating parties who will shortly lacerate each
other; and lastly, a most forbidding future preparing for
them. Such is a faint picture of the evils which a rebellious
and unconstitutional rising has already produced. But all
that has hitherto been witnessed is in no wise to be compared
to the consequences which must result from an unseasonable
separation, which has been demanded with a 
levity which no man of sense can comprehend.</p>

<p>It is true, that among the men who figure as the
authors and supporters of a separation, there are to be
observed no manufacturers: and, indeed, what manufacturer,
what merchant, what agriculturist even, could fall
into such an error?</p>

<p>You cry out for a separation, and would fain persuade
yourselves that it would be all in your favour. With
similar levity you take upon yourselves to dictate the conditions
of a separation. This shows but little foresight.</p>

<p>The northern part of the kingdom has taken up the
gauntlet, which you so imprudently threw down. Hear
one of their organs, and consider the consequences which
must, and ought to ensue to Belgium when once isolated
and abandoned to itself.”</p>

<p>The following is the reply of the Dutch to your challenge:—</p>

<p>“‘We are glad,’ say they, ‘that the proposal for a
divorce has been made by you. Let it take place, and the
cloud which has darkened the horizon of our country will
be dissipated. A glorious sun will then soon shine upon it.
Soon will the decadence of Amsterdam and its causes cease,
and the separation will give it the life and activity which it
lost by the union.</p>

<p>But let us examine what will be the result of this
divorce to the northern provinces?</p>

<p>Relieved from an odious manufacturing system, we
shall be able to establish our customs on a perfectly commercial
system: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Dort, Middleburgh,
will become so many free ports, into which moderate
duties, exempt from vexatious modes of collection, will
bring back our old commerce in all its force. The duties at
present imposed upon sugar, coffee, and other articles of
trade, will be revoked.</p>

<p>The inhabitants will purchase fuel, clothing, stuffs,
and all the commodities which trade, manufacture, and
the necessities of a people require, in England, and wherever
they can produce them upon better terms than in the
southern provinces, where all these articles will be loaded
with duties and restrictions, and will be therefore dearer.</p>

<p>Our country will again become the centre and mart
of all the productions and riches of the world which are
destined for and consumed in Germany and the provinces
of France bordering on the Rhine, as well as in many other
places which now escape us.</p>

<p>The products of our colonies will be no longer carried
except to our own ports, to the exclusion of all others, and
they will be freed from all the duties and charges with
which they are at present burdened, and which our Sovereign
has established for the advantage of the Belgians alone.
Thus not only the mother country, but the colonies, also,
will enjoy the advantage of the separation. The duty of 25
per cent. established at Java in favour of the Belgians will
be abolished, and it is thus that, wherever the standard of
Holland shall be displayed, liberty, prosperity, and public
happiness will prevail; and let no one present to you as a
burdensome set-off the debt which will remain to our
charge.’”</p>

Carignan of Piedmont, M. Rogier, Count de Merode, the
present King of Greece, Prince John of Saxony, the Duke
